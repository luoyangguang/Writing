  abstract = {This tutorial paper surveys the main features of Uppaal SMC, a model checking approach in Uppaal family that allows us to reason on networks of complex real-timed systems with a stochastic semantic. We demonstrate the modeling features of the tool, new veriﬁcation algorithms and ways of applying them to potentially complex case studies.},

  abstract = {Timed Petri nets (TPNs) have been utilized as visual formalism for the modeling of complex discrete-event dynamic systems. They illuminate the features in describing the properties of causality and concurrency. Moreover, it is well known that a synchronized TPN (STPN) allows us to present all of the concurrent states in a complex TPN. In this paper, we propose a new methodology to design and analyze an urban traffic network control system by using the STPN. In addition, the applications of the STPN to eight-phase, six-phase, and two-phase traffic-light control systems are modularized. The advantage of the proposed approach is the clear presentation of the behaviors of traffic lights in terms of the conditions and events that cause phase alternations. Moreover, the size of the urban traffic network control system can be easily extended with our proposed modular technique. An analysis of the control models is performed via a reachability graph method to demonstrate how the models enforce the transitions of the traffic lights.},

  abstract = {An important characteristic of models concerns the representation of the system behaviour along the time scale. While it is obvious that any instrument for the measurement of time operates according to a discrete time scale, due to its finite precision, and that most interesting modern systems, being digital in nature, intrinsicallyuse a discrete time scale, models often use a continuous time scale. The reason for this discrepancy lies in the greater simplicity of continuous time models. Indeed, if the time axis is discrete, the model has to consider the fact that multiple events may occur between two consecutive time marks, and explore the effect of all possible combinations among these events. In the continuous time scale, instead, using appropriate probabilistic assumptions, it is possible to univocally order events, so that it is always possible to take into consideration only one event at a time.},

The approach used in this paper proposes a components-based design, which increases modularity, reduces complexity and is a good practice according to modern Systems Engineering. The main system elements are specified based on the proposed Petri net component with time intervals associated to places. The specified models are simulated through the common token player algorithm, and formal analysis using invariants and theorem proving are applied to verify models' soundness and to reason on specific scenarios.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with modelling of traffic networks for real time control purposes. A modular framework based on coloured timed Petri nets is proposed to model the dynamics of signalized traffic network systems: places represent link cells and crossing sections, tokens are vehicles and token colours represent the routing of the corresponding vehicle. In addition, an ordinary timed Petri net models the signal timing plan controlling the area. The proposed modelling framework is applied to a real intersection located in Bari, Italy. A discrete event simulation of the controlled intersection validates the model and tests the signal timing plan obtained by an optimization strategy presented in the related literature.},

  abstract = {A microscopic model of signalized urban areas and its representation by means of stochastic-timed Petri nets are described in this paper, where a traffic-responsive control strategy, whose objective is the optimization of green duration of each stage, is also proposed. The Petri net representation here proposed is the new version of a previously proposed one, which was based on deterministic-timed Petri nets. The motivations of the need of proposing a new version and the differences between the two Petri net representations are clearly described. In addition, some results on the application of the proposed methodology to a single signalized intersection are included in the paper.},
