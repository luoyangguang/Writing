  abstract = {Device-to-device (D2D) communication presents a new paradigm in mobile networking to facilitate data exchange between physically proximate devices. The development of D2D is driven by mobile operators to harvest short range communications for improving network performance and supporting proximity-based services. In this paper, we investigate two fundamental and interrelated aspects of D2D communication, security and privacy, which are essential for the adoption and deployment of D2D. We present an extensive review of the state-of-the-art solutions for enhancing security and privacy in D2D communication. By summarizing the challenges, requirements, and features of different proposals, we identify lessons to be learned from existing studies and derive a set of “best practices.” The primary goal of our work is to equip researchers and developers with a better understanding of the underlying problems and the potential solutions for D2D security and privacy. To inspire follow-up research, we identify open problems and highlight future directions with regard to system and communication design. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review to address the fundamental security and privacy issues in D2D communication.},

  abstract = {As the deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) is experiencing an exponential growth, it is no surprise that many recent cyber attacks are IoT-enabled: The attacker initially exploits some vulnerable IoT technology as a first step towards compromising a critical system that is connected, in some way, with the IoT. For some sectors, like industry, smart grids, transportation and medical services, the significance of such attacks is obvious, since IoT technologies are part of critical back-end systems. However, in sectors where IoT is usually at the end-user side, like smart homes, such attacks can be underestimated, since not all possible attack paths are examined. In this paper we survey IoT-enabled cyber attacks, found in all application domains since 2010. For each sector, we emphasize on the latest, verified IoT-enabled attacks, based on known real-world incidents and published proof-of-concept attacks. We methodologically analyze representative attacks that demonstrate direct, indirect and subliminal attack paths against critical targets. Our goal is threefold: (i) To assess IoT-enabled cyber attacks in a risk-like approach, in order to demonstrate their current threat landscape; (ii) To identify hidden and subliminal IoT-enabled attack paths against critical infrastructures and services, and (iii) To examine mitigation strategies for all application domains.},

These networks need to be able to offer services at high quality levels for a massive amount of users and smart objects. In this paper, we analyse the Quality of Service (QoS) of our Relay and Mobility Scheme for the Internet of Things (REMOS-IOT), which consists of IoT objects that provide several services such as video applications, CCTV monitoring and sensor data, smart gateways, which interconnect the smart devices, and a cloud-deployed platform which is used for resource management and decision-making to improve network quality. This paper presents a novel algorithm which considers QoS, devices locations and service relevance metrics and creates more appropriate clusters for the networked IoT objects in order to improve IoT services quality. Objects are then attached to gateways or relay devices with better network quality, while the performance of poorly operating clusters is also improved.},

These attacks can easily be accomplished by an adversary by either bypassing MAC-layer protocols or emitting a radio signal targeted at jamming a particular channel. In this article we survey different jamming attacks that may be employed against a sensor network. In order to cope with the problem of jamming, we discuss a two-phase strategy involving the diagnosis of the attack, followed by a suitable defense strategy. We highlight the challenges associated with detecting jamming. To cope with jamming, we propose two different but complementary approaches. One approach is to simply retreat from the interferer which may be accomplished by either spectral evasion (channel surfing) or spatial evasion (spatial retreats). The second approach aims to compete more actively with the interferer by adjusting resources, such as power levels and communication coding, to achieve communication in the presence of the jammer.},

  abstract = {This paper provides an overview of the Internet of Things (IoT) with emphasis on enabling technologies, protocols, and application issues. The IoT is enabled by the latest developments in RFID, smart sensors, communication technologies, and Internet protocols. The basic premise is to have smart sensors collaborate directly without human involvement to deliver a new class of applications. The current revolution in Internet, mobile, and machine-to-machine (M2M) technologies can be seen as the first phase of the IoT. In the coming years, the IoT is expected to bridge diverse technologies to enable new applications by connecting physical objects together in support of intelligent decision making. This paper starts by providing a horizontal overview of the IoT. Then, we give an overview of some technical details that pertain to the IoT enabling technologies, protocols, and applications. Compared to other survey papers in the field, our objective is to provide a more thorough summary of the most relevant protocols and application issues to enable researchers and application developers to get up to speed quickly on how the different protocols fit together to deliver desired functionalities without having to go through RFCs and the standards specifications. We also provide an overview of some of the key IoT challenges presented in the recent literature and provide a summary of related research work. Moreover, we explore the relation between the IoT and other emerging technologies including big data analytics and cloud and fog computing. We also present the need for better horizontal integration among IoT services. Finally, we present detailed service use-cases to illustrate how the different protocols presented in the paper fit together to deliver desired IoT services.},

  abstract = {While Twitter and other Online Social Networks (OSNs) or microblogs are considered as a source of information for breaking news or uproarious and unexpected events, they could also be exploited as a dense worldwide sensors network for physical measurements. The corpus of geotagged posts from OSNs includes people’s feedbacks about a wide range of topics, with precise temporal and geographical metadata, that can be used as a support or an improvement to hardware sensors. For instance, if collocated people, independently and at the same time, write posts complaining about high temperatures, it could effectively denote a raise of heat in that place. In this paper, we explore the feasibility to use a geographical search on social networks, that is, a geosocial search, about air pollution related posts, as effective air impureness measurements. We evaluate our assumption in large cities over three continents of the planet, where a minimum increment about the number of air pollution related posts in an area, indeed corresponds to a raise of minimum pollution values in such area. Such a correlation can be exploited to integrate and extend existing air pollution monitoring networks. At the end of the manuscript we propose to further employ the time series of posts returned by the geosocial search to predict next pollution values.},

Although it is a common belief that this figure could shrink with the use of new sensor and communication technologies, unfortunately, none such systems have hit the road to date. Ideally, if such technologies were put into place, vehicles could be part of a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) capable of spreading relevant information about dangerous events (e.g., car accidents) to all approaching drivers. However, all this is mainly supported by simulation studies, as no practical results have been published to date, revealing the effective performances of such systems at work. In this paper, we fill this gap, presenting a detailed description of the greatest experiments (a few thousand throughout the streets of Los Angeles), to date, ever performed with an accident warning system specifically devised for highway scenarios. In particular, among all the possible candidate schemes, we ran a few thousand experiments with the accident warning system algorithm that was proven to be optimal in terms of bandwidth usage and covered distance in realistic scenarios. Our experiments confirm what has been observed before in theory and simulation, i.e., the use of such a system can reduce, by as much as 40\%, the amount of vehicles involved in highway pileups.},

Market research has shown a significant growth of sensor deployments over the past decade and has predicted a significant increment of the growth rate in the future. These sensors continuously generate enormous amounts of data. However, in order to add value to raw sensor data we need to understand it. Collection, modelling, reasoning, and distribution of context in relation to sensor data plays critical role in this challenge. Context-aware computing has proven to be successful in understanding sensor data. In this paper, we survey context awareness from an IoT perspective. We present the necessary background by introducing the IoT paradigm and context-aware fundamentals at the beginning. Then we provide an in-depth analysis of context life cycle. We evaluate a subset of projects (50) which represent the majority of research and commercial solutions proposed in the field of context-aware computing conducted over the last decade (2001-2011) based on our own taxonomy. Finally, based on our evaluation, we highlight the lessons to be learnt from the past and some possible directions for future research. The survey addresses a broad range of techniques, methods, models, functionalities, systems, applications, and middleware solutions related to context awareness and IoT. Our goal is not only to analyse, compare and consolidate past research work but also to appreciate their findings and discuss their applicability towards the IoT.},

Collecting data from these objects is an important task as it allows software systems to understand the environment better. Many different hardware devices may involve in the process of collecting and uploading sensor data to the cloud where complex processing can occur. Further, we cannot expect all these objects to be connected to the computers due to technical and economical reasons. Therefore, we should be able to utilize resource constrained devices to collect data from these ICOs. On the other hand, it is critical to process the collected sensor data before sending them to the cloud to make sure the sustainability of the infrastructure due to energy constraints. This requires to move the sensor data processing tasks towards the resource constrained computational devices (e.g. mobile phones). In this paper, we propose Mobile Sensor Data Processing Engine (MOSDEN), an plug-in-based IoT middleware for mobile devices, that allows to collect and process sensor data without programming efforts. Our architecture also supports sensing as a service model. We present the results of the evaluations that demonstrate its suitability towards real world deployments.

  abstract = {Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (cITS) are a promising technology to enhance driving safety and efficiency. Vehicles communicate wirelessly with other vehicles and infrastructure, thereby creating a highly dynamic and heterogeneously managed ad-hoc network. It is these network properties that make it a challenging task to protect integrity of the data and guarantee its correctness. A major component is the problem that traditional security mechanisms like PKI-based asymmetric cryptography only exclude outsider attackers that do not possess key material. However, because attackers can be insiders within the network (i.e., possess valid key material), this approach cannot detect all possible attacks. In this survey, we present misbehavior detection mechanisms that can detect such insider attacks based on attacker behavior and information analysis. In contrast to well-known intrusion detection for classical IT systems, these misbehavior detection mechanisms analyze information semantics to detect attacks, which aligns better with highly application-tailored communication protocols foreseen for cITS. In our survey, we provide an extensive introduction to the cITS ecosystem and discuss shortcomings of PKI-based security. We derive and discuss a classification for misbehavior detection mechanisms, provide an in-depth overview of seminal papers on the topic, and highlight open issues and possible future research trends.},

One of the key issues enabling future solutions is achieving an effective integration between mobile apps and vehicles. Such integration can be efficiently achieved on all existing vehicles by relying on the On Board Diagnostic (OBD-II) interface. This allows obtaining critical information such as speed, fuel consumption, gas emissions and system failures. In this paper we propose a vehicle emulation platform, called VEWE, that allows developing and testing OBD-II aware applications. The advantages of this approach include: avoiding the need for a real vehicle, allowing to easily generate realistic vehicle parameter patterns, and supporting emulated GPS functionality. We evaluate our platform by conducting a performance analysis in terms of OBD-II response times and channel capacity when relying on a Bluetooth adapter. We compare our results with respect to those obtained in real vehicles, and demonstrate that our VEWE platform behaves similarly to realistic on board devices, thereby providing a complete and reliable platform for smartphone application development.},

Existing smartphones are endowed with multiple wireless interfaces and high computational power, being able to perform a wide variety of tasks. By combining smartphones with existing vehicles through an appropriate interface we are able to move closer to the smart vehicle paradigm, offering the user new functionalities and services when driving. In this paper we propose an Androidbased application that monitors the vehicle through an On Board Diagnostics (OBD-II) interface, being able to detect accidents. Our proposed application estimates the G force experienced by the passengers in case of a frontal collision, which is used together with airbag triggers to detect accidents. The application reacts to positive detection by sending details about the accident through either e-mail or SMS to pre-defined destinations, immediately followed by an automatic phone call to the emergency services. Experimental results using a real vehicle show that the application is able to react to accident events in less than 3 seconds, a very low time, validating the feasibility of smartphone based solutions for improving safety on the road.},

  abstract = {Vehicular networks are inseparable components of a smart city environment due to several applications that improve life quality, safety and security. Applications of vehicular networks vary from safety applications such as blind spot warning and traffic light violations to non-safety applications such as entertainment, optimal speed advisory and/or congestion/accident information. Recently established standards such as IEEE 802.11p and IEEE 1609 help achieve effective communications between vehicles and the infrastructure. However, vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) are still considered as one of the challenging forms of wireless communication technologies that complement Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) that aim at the betterment of the transportation in cooperation with the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). VANETs are specialized form of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) where protocols performed well in MANETs may not be ideal for VANETs due to high mobility, intermittent connectivity and heterogeneity. With the advent of cloud computing paradigm, offloading local resources to a shared pool of resources has been an ideal solution for compute-intensive and memory-intensive applications. Hence, the concept of vehicular clouds has been introduced to facilitate VANET applications in a resource efficient way with rapid elasticity and on the pay-as-you go business model. This chapter presents a comprehensive survey of VANET applications in smart cities along with challenges, solutions and existing implementations. Furthermore, it introduces the state of the art in vehicular clouds for smart cities following an introduction of various vehicular cloud architectures. Moreover open issues and future directions are presented and discussed to help stimulate future studies in this emerging research field.},

  abstract = {Surveillance and safety systems for pedestrians and bicyclists are becoming much more important because there continue to be a large number of traffic accidents that involve vulnerable road users. In this paper, we propose an urban road user classification framework using local feature descriptors and hidden Markov models (HMM). Our framework achieved pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcyclist classification in high ac­ curacy. The framework consists of two classification meth­ ods: pedestrian-bicyclist classification and bicyclist-motorcyclist classification. First, we discriminate between pedestrians and bicyclist-like objects using histograms of oriented gradients (HOG)-based classifiers. We implemented a cascade classifier using generic HOG and our original local feature descrip­ tor called co-occurrence semantic HOG. Bicyclist-like objects mainly consist of bicyclists and motorcyclists. We focused on the objects' leg motions and classify them using the hidden Markov models (HMM)-based motion models. We conducted experiments with real traffic scenes to evaluate the performance of our framework. The experiments for pedestrian-bicyclist classification and bicyclist-motorcyclist classification are con­ ducted independently and both methods achieve nearly 90\% on classification.},

  abstract = {Vehicles provide an ideal platforms for a plethora of emerging applications such as networked gaming, multimedia content delivery and urban sensing. Cars have no power constraints and they can be instrumented with high end computational units and graphic devices. The deployment at scale of urban vehicular systems, however, requires a careful design able to consider challenges across several domains. Vehicular systems are arguably a prominent example of cyber-physical systems. The development of such systems requires a truly multidisciplinary approach and a close integration between the application, communication, and physical domains. Hardware and software mounted on vehicles will face a harsh physical and communication environment that will greatly affect all the system components. In this paper we report on the challenges and opportunities for multimedia vehicular urban sensing systems based on our field experiences in Macao (China) and Los Angels (USA). We designed and built the components for a pollution monitoring system able to support closed-loop optimization between pollution and traffic management. Our initial set of prototype vehicles are now running in the city of Macao and they are measuring the air parameters as well as the urban traffic. The paper aims at exposing some of the issues encountered, outlining the problems of a city wide deployment, and augmenting our in-field experience with the results from large scale simulation studies.},

The car is now a formidable sensor platform, absorbing information from the environment (and from other cars) and feeding it to drivers and infrastructure to assist in safe navigation, pollution control and traffic management. The next step in this evolution is just around the corner: the Internet of Autonomous Vehicles. Pioneered by the Google car, the Internet of Vehicles will be a distributed transport fabric capable to make its own decisions about driving customers to their destinations. Like other important instantiations of the Internet of Things (e.g., the smart building), the Internet of Vehicles will have communications, storage, intelligence, and learning capabilities to anticipate the customers’ intentions. The concept that will help transition to the Internet of Vehicles is the Vehicular Cloud, the equivalent of Internet cloud for vehicles, providing all the services required by the autonomous vehicles. In this article, we discuss the evolution from Intelligent Vehicle Grid to Autonomous, Internet-connected Vehicles, and Vehicular Cloud.},

Urban planners are looking for solutions to reduce traffic congestion. Realtime traffic information obtained from vehicles can help reduce congestion exploiting the wireless communications architecture recently established for safety and traffic control purposes. In this paper, we propose NAVOPT, a vehicular routing strategy assisted by the on board navigator as well as the navigation server. The on board navigator equipped with area map and GPS monitor, reports its own position to the server via wireless connection (WiFi or 3G); in turns, it acquires from the Server a minimum cost path (i.e. path with shortest travel time) under the current traffic conditions. Under NAVOPT, the Server uses a flow deviation (FD) algorithm to compute optimal vehicle routes by load balancing vehicle traffic over alternate routes. We establish an analytic model of NAVOPT; we also simulate it using a SUMO simulator to verify its accuracy. From the simulation results, the NAVOPT model shows robustness to delay and speed and efficacy in controlling the traffic as the number of vehicles increases.},

  abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging technology that aims to connect our environment to the internet in the same way that personal computers connected people. As this technology progresses, the IoT paradigm becomes more prevalent in our everyday lives. The nature of IoT applications necessitates devices that are low-cost, power-sensitive, integrated, unobtrusive, and interoperable with existing cloud platforms and services, for example, Amazon AWS IoT, IBM Watson IoT. As a result, these devices are often small in size, with just enough computing power needed for their specific tasks. These resource-constrained devices are often unable to implement traditional network security measures and represent a vulnerability to network attackers as a result. Few frameworks are positioned to handle the influx of this new technology and the security concerns associated with it. Current solutions fail to provide a comprehensive and multilayer solution to these inherent IoT security vulnerabilities. This paper presents a layered approach to IoT testbed that aims to bridge multiple connection standards and cloud platforms. To solve challenges surrounding this multi-layer IoT testbed, we propose a mesh inside a mesh IoT network architecture. Our designed “edge router” incorporates two mesh networks together and performs seamlessly transmission of multi-standard packets. The proposed IoT testbed interoperates with existing multi-standards (Wi-Fi, 6LoWPAN) and segments of networks, and provides both Internet and resilient sensor coverage to the cloud platform. To ensure confidentiality and authentication of IoT devices when interoperating with multiple service platforms, we propose optimized cryptographic techniques and software frameworks for IoT devices. We propose to extend and modify the existing open-source IDS platforms such as Snort to support IoT platforms and environments. We validate the efficacy of the proposed system by evaluating its performance and effect on key system resources. The work within this testbed design and implementation provides a solid foundation for further IoT system development.},

Mesh networking allows wider low cost Internet access while blockchain enables complete transparency and accountability for investments and revenue or other forms of economic compensations from sharing of network traffic, content and services. Crowdsourcing network coverage combined with crowdfunding costs can create sustainable yet decentralized Internet access infrastructures, where every participant can invest in resources, and pay and be paid for usage. While mesh networks and mesh routing protocols enable self-organized networks that expand organically, cryptocurrencies and smart contracts enable the economic coordination among network providers and consumers.

The popularly used PoW (Proof of Work) consensus algorithm applied to the public blockchain requires the price to be compensated in order to agree on the validity of the transaction. This has the disadvantage that the system doesn’t operate without compensation. Also, the BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) Algorithm using private blockchain has a limited number of acceptable malicious users. In this case, if the users collude with malicious and exceed the limited number, the transaction is rejected. In this paper, we propose a Smart Manager System and RMBC-DBFT (Randomized Mesh Blockchain Diversity of opinion BFT) enables the safe transaction to the problems above.},

  abstract = {A limitation of current LoRa networks is their single-hop nature. This causes difficulties in areas with poor Internet access, such as remote rural areas, or challenging radio environments, for example in metropolitan areas, as the LoRa gateway must be placed at a location with backhaul access to the network server, but must nonetheless be reachable by all end devices. To facilitate these applications, we present a new routing protocol to enable mesh networking with LoRa, allowing for multihop networking between gateways to extend coverage. Our protocol is tailored specifically to the requirements of LoRa networks. We have developed a proof-of-concept implementation of the protocol and have shown its effectiveness in both laboratory tests and a field trial in a real-world LoRa deployment.},

Although LoRa shows good performance for long-distance transmission in the countryside, its radio signals can be attenuated and interfered with by buildings, trees and other signal sources. In urban areas, our observation shows that LoRa requires a dense deployment of LoRa gateways to ensure that indoor LoRa devices can transfer data back to remote servers. Mesh networking is a solution for increasing the communication range and packet delivery ratio without the need to install additional LoRa gateways. This study presents our design of a LoRa mesh-networking module for IoT applications (e.g.,collecting data from multiple, widely distributed sensors on a university campus). We deployed 19 LoRa mesh-networking devices distributed in an 800m by 600m area on campus to serve as a gateway and to collect data at one-minute intervals. The results show our LoRa mesh networking module achieved a 88.49\% packet delivery ratio (PDR), while the LoRaWAN in starnetwork topology was only 58.7\% under the same conditions.},

  abstract = {The LoRa technology has emerged as an interesting solution for low power, long range IoT applications by proposing multiple ”degrees of freedom” at the physical layer. This flexibility provides either a long range at the cost of a lower data rate or higher throughput at the cost of low sensitivity, so a shorter range. In this paper, we analyze the flexibility of LoRa and propose various strategies to adapt its radio parameters (such as the spreading factor, bandwidth, and transmission power) to different deployment scenarios. We compute the energy consumption of LoRa transceivers using various radio configurations in both star and mesh topologies. Our simulation results show that in a star topology, we can achieve the optimal scaling-up/down strategy of LoRa radio parameters to obtain either a high data rate or a long range while respecting low energy consumption. In mesh networks, energy consumption is optimized by exploiting various radio configurations and the network topology (e.g., the number of hops, the network density, the cell coverage). Finally, we propose a strategy to take advantage of both star and mesh topologies.},

IPv6 over low-power wireless personal area networks (6LoWPAN) are considered to be a crucial network in short-range low-power networks where 6LoWPAN motes will account for the majority of short-range low-power things. Also, LoRaWAN and SigFox are two major networking landscapes and players in long-range, low-power networks or oftentimes called low-power wide area networks (LPWAN). This paper reviews and compares 6LoWPAN and LPWAN in terms of network architecture, protocol stack, applications and security. In general, LPWAN networks are more demanding in terms of node and link constraints than 6LoWPAN networks (e.g. very low payload size, very low data rate and very limited resources). Also, as yet, LPWAN networks do not have IPv6 addressing capabilities. Each network category has its unique characteristics and strengths and each category has its important role in the IoT world.},

With the advantage of distributed architecture and close to end-users, fog/edge computing can provide faster response and greater quality of service for IoT applications. Thus, fog/edge computing-based IoT becomes future infrastructure on IoT development. To develop fog/edge computing-based IoT infrastructure, the architecture, enabling techniques, and issues related to IoT should be investigated first, and then the integration of fog/edge computing and IoT should be explored. To this end, this paper conducts a comprehensive overview of IoT with respect to system architecture, enabling technologies, security and privacy issues, and present the integration of fog/edge computing and IoT, and applications. Particularly, this paper first explores the relationship between cyber-physical systems and IoT, both of which play important roles in realizing an intelligent cyber-physical world. Then, existing architectures, enabling technologies, and security and privacy issues in IoT are presented to enhance the understanding of the state of the art IoT development. To investigate the fog/edge computing-based IoT, this paper also investigate the relationship between IoT and fog/edge computing, and discuss issues in fog/edge computing-based IoT. Finally, several applications, including the smart grid, smart transportation, and smart cities, are presented to demonstrate how fog/edge computing-based IoT to be implemented in real-world applications.},

Research has shown a substantial development of solutions for a wide range of devices and IoT platforms over the past 6-7 years. However, each solution provides its own IoT infrastructure, devices, APIs, and data formats leading to interoperability issues. Such interoperability issues are the consequence of many critical issues such as vendor lock-in, impossibility to develop IoT application exposing cross-platform, and/or cross-domain, difficulty in plugging non-interoperable IoT devices into different IoT platforms, and ultimately prevents the emergence of IoT technology at a large-scale. To enable seamless resource sharing between different IoT vendors, efforts by several academia, industry, and standardization bodies have emerged to help IoT interoperability, i.e., the ability for multiple IoT platforms from different vendors to work together. This paper performs a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art solutions for facilitating interoperability between different IoT platforms. Also, the key challenges in this topic is presented.},

  abstract = {In the near future, all our everyday things and objects will be both connected to the Internet and equipped with enough sensing, acting and processing capabilities to exploit the full potential benefits of the so called Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. Even the simplest objects will become “smart” because they will be interconnected to other objects to share and collect data from the environments in which they are placed thus paving the way to novel application services, computing and communication scenarios. In this context, interoperability among different standards and communication technologies is still a significant challenge that we have started to address by proposing a smartphone-based mobile gateway acting as a flexible and transparent interface between different IoT devices and the Internet. The presented unified, high-level and extendible software architecture supports opportunistic IoT devices discovery, control and management coupled with data processing, collection and diffusion functionalities. A specific testbed on common smartphones with different hardware and software capabilities was deployed to evaluate the real feasibility of the designed solution measuring the system performance in terms of energy consumption, memory and CPU usage in high and low load scenarios. According to the obtained results, the implemented software architecture for multi-standard and multi-technology interoperation presents a reduced use of hardware resources in front of a relatively high energy consumption value, mostly due to the simultaneously active radio interfaces combined with a small battery capacity, that limits the smartphone lifetime. Nevertheless, the presented general approach is still remarkable because this latter aspect will most likely be exceeded, in a short time, thanks to daily technological advancements in both batteries and radio interfaces.},

Although many related ideas have been proposed, there are very few literatures with theoretical and data support. This paper focuses on the research of model construction and performance evaluation. First, an IoT security model is established based on blockchain and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). In this model, many security risks of traditional IoT architectures can be avoided, and system performance is significantly improved in distributed large capacity storage, concurrency and query. Secondly, the performance of the proposed model is evaluated through the average latency and throughput, which are meaningful for further research and optimization of this direction.

  doi = {10.1109/ISCC.2018.8538551},
  abstract = {With numerous emerging internet of things (IoT) devices, they generate big data. The big data transmitted to the cloud or fog will consume massive network bandwidth. This may result in the IoT network easily encountering network congestion. Moreover, there are IoT applications that need to transfer multimedia data with multiple quality of service (QoS) requirements. A state-of-the-art, MINA, intends to meet multiple QoS requirements of IoT applications; however, it is unable to guarantee QoS requirements of high-priority IoT applications and it is also unable to adapt to the current network status. To conquer the above problems, we propose an application-aware QoS routing algorithm (AQRA) for SDN-based IoT networking to guarantee multiple QoS requirements of high-priority IoT applications and to adapt to the current network status for better routing paths. Evaluation results have shown that, the AQRA has better fitness ratios of QoS requirements compared to MINA while multiple QoS requirements of high-priority IoT applications are guaranteed. The AQRA improves the average end-to-end flow performance by 10.75\%, 11.88\% and 10.82\% compared to MINA in terms of delay, jitter and packet loss rate, respectively. The AQRA improves the standard deviation of end-to-end flow performance by 14.37\%, 17.95\% and 14.28\% compared to MINA in terms of delay, jitter and packet loss rate, respectively. In addition, the runtime of the AQRA is 38.56\% shorter than that of MINA.},

That is why, IoT is presently spanning over a diverse range of applications in the fields of education, healthcare, agriculture, military, industry, etc. The resources IoT requires in those applications are heterogeneous in nature, for example, storage, processor, network, sensor nodes, energy, etc. The obvious challenge is how to manage these limited resources efficiently. Quite recently a number of attempts have been made towards an optimal resource management using various scheduling schemes. This paper broadly divides these scheduling schemes into three aspects, namely Quality of Services (QoS), IoT architecture, and IoT network infrastructure. The paper also presents an analysis based on different metrics of IoT resource scheduling and a comparison among different resource scheduling techniques. A section of this analysis is dedicated to the simulation model analyses involved in different scheduling schemes. Finally, we believe there is still a lot of scope in improving IoT resource management maintaining the overall quality needed. The paper considers with such a future direction of research in this field.},

This technology offers a huge business value for organizations and provides opportunities for many existing applications such as energy, healthcare and other sectors. However, as new emergent technology, IoT suffers from several security issues which are most challenging than those from other fields regarding its complex environment and resources-constrained IoT devices. A lot of researches have been initiated in order to provide efficient security solutions in IoT, particularly to address resources constraints and scalability issues. Furthermore, some technologies related to networking and cryptocurrency fields such as Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Blockchain are revolutionizing the world of the Internet of Things thanks to their efficiency and scalability. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive top down survey of the most recent proposed security and privacy solutions in IoT. We discuss particularly the benefits that new approaches such as blockchain and Software Defined Networking can bring to the security and the privacy in IoT in terms of flexibility and scalability.

Also, access to high bandwidth, extendibility and dynamic management are of critical significance, especially when network devices are vertically integrated. Hence, a set of unique predefined line commands and operating systems or firmware should be used. SDN (software-defined networking) is a structure designed for simplifying and improving network management with high flexibility by splitting control plane and data plane. Thus, network programmability is enhanced which in turn leads to more innovation opportunities. Although SDN is regarded as a new research issue, it has attracted numerous researchers’ attention from both industrial and academic institutes. In this paper, data plane, control plane and application plane as the three planes of SDN and the interfaces between them such as OpenFlow are investigated and the challenges and the latest technologies in relation to SDN are examined. The investigation and overview of SDN reported in this paper might be used by the interested future researchers to better understand and apply SDN in real-life applications.},

  abstract = {Software defined networking (SDN) brings about innovation, simplicity in network management, and configuration in network computing. Traditional networks often lack the flexibility to bring into effect instant changes because of the rigidity of the network and also the over dependence on proprietary services. SDN decouples the control plane from the data plane, thus moving the control logic from the node to a central controller. A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a great platform for low-rate wireless personal area networks with little resources and short communication ranges. However, as the scale of WSN expands, it faces several challenges, such as network management and heterogeneous-node networks. The SDN approach to WSNs seeks to alleviate most of the challenges and ultimately foster efficiency and sustainability in WSNs. The fusion of these two models gives rise to a new paradigm: Software defined wireless sensor networks (SDWSN). The SDWSN model is also envisioned to play a critical role in the looming Internet of Things paradigm. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the SDWSN literature. Moreover, it delves into some of the challenges facing this paradigm, as well as the major SDWSN design requirements that need to be considered to address these challenges.},

The problem consists in the selection of the most suitable from all radio access technologies available. The decision process is called network selection, and depends on several parameters, such as quality of service, mobility, cost, energy, battery life, etc. Several methods and approaches have been proposed in this context, with their objective being to offer the best QoS to the users, and/or to maximize re-usability of the networks. This paper represents a survey of the network selection methods used. Multiple attribute-dependent decision-making methods are presented. Furthermore, the game theory concept is illustrated, the use of the fuzzy logic is presented, and the utility functions defining the network selection process are discussed.},

  abstract = {The forecast dramatic growth, of the number of Machine-toMachine (M2M) communications, challenges the traditional networks of Mobile Network Operators (MNO). In fact, a large number of devices may attempt simultaneously to access the base station, which may result in severe congestions at the random-access channel (RACH) level. To alleviate such congestion while regulating the M2M devices’ opportunities to transmit, the Access Class Barring (ACB) process was proposed. In this article, we propose a novel implementation of the ACB mechanism in the context of multiple M2M traffic classes. Based on a scheduling algorithm, we have applied a PID controller to adjust dynamically multiple ACB factors related to each class category, guaranteeing a number of devices around an optimal value that maximizes the Random Access (RA) success probability. The obtained results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed mechanism by increasing the success probability and minimizing radio resources’ underutilization with respect to each class priority.},

  abstract = {The next mobile generation is planned to create a networked society, in which Machine-to-machine (M2M) communications are expected to play a key role in a plethora of domains and applications. The massive deployment of such devices may overwhelm the cellular network by imposing strong constraints on the Radio Access Network (RAN) because of the radio resources’ scarcity. As the base station cannot accurately get the exact number of M2M arrivals, it cannot really predict the overload status, which limits any control action. Consequently, a better estimation of this number would efficiently help to overcome the risk of congestion. In this paper, we proposed a novel fluid model for M2M communications, which allows gaining an enhanced understanding of the dynamics of such systems. The provided analysis of the model was used to devise a new method to estimate accurately the number of M2M devices willing to connect as well as the number of random access attempts.We proposed, then, a novel implementation of the ACB process, which dynamically computes the ACB factor according to the network’s overload conditions while includes a corrective action adapting the controller action based on the mismatch existing between the computed and the targeted mean load. Compared to existing approaches, the simulation results show that the proposed algorithms allow improving considerably the estimation of the number of M2M devices’ arrivals, while outperforming existing techniques in terms of the number of abandons, the success and the collision probabilities, and the average access delay.},

This leads to an explosively growth of simultaneous M2M arrivals, and then a bursty random access attempts that causes a severe random access congestion. One of the key solutions to deal with such congestion is the Access Class Barring (ACB) scheme. However, this scheme presents many limits when dealing with baseline congestions. Indeed, in such conditions, it induces a synchronization of the terminals willing to connect, as we demonstrated in the paper, which results in poor performances. Thus, we proposed, in this paper, a new method to estimate accurately the number of random access attempts in a way to measure efficiently the congestion level. Then, we proposed a novel implementation of the ACB process that mainly consists of dynamically adapting the ACB factor according to the network’s overload conditions. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing solutions by improving significantly the access’s success probability while minimizing radio resources’ underutilization.

It represents a key component of Internet of Things (IoT) and smart spaces. One of the most difficult challenges to support M2M communications is their huge number compared to available radio resources. Hence, to deal with random access channel (RACH) overload and to better control the access in LTE-A Networks, the 3GPP proposed the Access Class Barring (ACB) factor concept. In this paper, we proposed an algorithm to improve this method based on adaptive multiple ACB factors, according to M2M traffic category with respect to their access delay budget and drop rate (QoS parameters). Simulations were done for testing the effectiveness of our MACB scheme and show that using multiples ACB factors and dynamically adjusting them to the congestion level in addition to traffic type category increases the access probability and reduces overload. The obtained results were then compared to the basic ACB method and show that the access probability increases especially for high priority traffic.},

secteurs comme la ville, le transport ou la santé. En 2020, les études affirment que les appareils connectés à Internet devraient compter entre 26 milliards et 50 milliards d’unités. [2, 3] La qualité de service d’application IoT dépend non seulement du réseau Internet et de l’infrastructure de communication, mais aussi du fonctionnement et des performances des appareils IoT. Par conséquent, les nouveaux paramètres de QoS tels que la précision des données et la disponibilité des appareils deviennent importants pour les applications IoT par rapport aux applications Internet. Le grand nombre de dispositifs et d’applications IoT connectés à Internet, et le flux de
trafic spontané entre eux rendent la gestion de la qualité de service complexe à travers l’infrastructure Internet. D’un autre côté, les dispositifs non-IP et leurs capacités limitées en termes d’énergie et de transmission créent l’environnement dynamique et contraint. De plus, l’interconnexion de bout en bout entre les dispositifs et les applications n’est pas possible. Aussi, les applications sont intéressées par les données collectées, pas à la source spécifique qui les produit. Le Software Defined Networking (SDN) est un nouveau paradigme pour les réseaux informatiques apparu récemment pour cacher la complexité de l’architecture de réseau traditionnelle (par exemple de l’Internet) et briser la fermeture des systèmes de réseau dans les fonctions de contrôle et de données. Il permet aux propriétaires et aux administrateurs de réseau de contrôler et de gérer le comportement du réseau par programme, en découplant le plan de contrôle du plan de données. SDN a le potentiel de révolutionner les réseaux informatiques
classiques existants, en offrant plusieurs avantages tels que la gestion centralisée, la programmabilité du réseau, l’efficacité des coûts d’exploitation, et les innovations. Dans cette thèse, nous étudions la gestion de ressources sur l’infrastructure IoT, y compris les réseaux de transport/Internet et de détection. Nous profitons de la technologie SDN comme le futur d’Internet pour offrir un système de support QoS flexible et adaptatif pour les services IoT. Nous présentons un intergiciel basé sur SDN pour définir un cadre de gestion de QoS pour gérer les besoins spécifiques de chaque application à travers l’infrastructure IoT. De plus, nous proposons un nouveau modèle QoS qui prend en compte les préférences de QoS

The IoT vision is to extend the Internet into our everyday lives, so the number of connected devices and innovative applications are growing very fast to bring intelligence into
as many domains as possible. The QoS for IoT application not only depends on the Internet network and communication
infrastructure, it is also impacted by the operation and performance of IoT sensing infrastructure. Therefore, the new QoS parameters such as data accuracy, sampling rate, and
device availability become important for the IoT applications compared to the Internet applications. The huge number of the Internet-connected IoT devices and application, and the spontaneous traffic flow among them make the management of the quality of service complex
across the Internet infrastructure. On the other hand, the non-IP devices and their limited capabilities in terms of energy and transmission create the dynamic environment and hinder the direct interaction between devices and applications. The quality of service is becoming one of the critical non-functional IoT element which needs research and studies. A flexible and scalable QoS management mechanism must be implemented in IoT system to keep up with the growth rate of the Internet-connected IoT devices and applications as well as their heterogeneity and diversity. The solution should address the IoT application requirements and user satisfaction while considering the system dynamism, limitations, and characteristics. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging paradigm in computer networking which separates the control plane and the data plane of the network elements. It makes the network
elements programmable via the centralized control plane. This approach enables more agile management and control over the network behavior. In this thesis, we take advantage of SDN technology as the future of the Internet to offer a
flexible and adaptive QoS support scheme for the IoT services. We present an SDN-based middleware to define a QoS management framework to manage the application specific QoS
needs across the IoT infrastructure including transport and sensing network. Also, we propose a new QoS model that takes into account the application QoS preferences and the network
elements status to allocate effectively the resources for the applications across SDN network while maximizing network performance.},

  abstract = {Network selection receives considerable attention from communication networks researchers. This remarkable interest is motivated by the variety of the existing technologies and the offered services. The widespread use of these services leads to growth in the expectations and requirements of mobile users in terms of e ciency. This thesis focuses on proposing and evaluating new network selection models for heterogeneous wireless networks, and providing a real-time selection of always best connected network while maintaining the QoS for different multimedia services. The main contribution consists of the proposal of a model of multi-criteria network selection. This model is open in the sense that it can accommodate the implementation of different parameters in the decision of the network that may be selected, considering the type of application used by the mobile user. This thesis is developed from two aspects: Network selection algorithms proposition and performance study. In the first part, three complementary solutions were proposed to enable a fair and thoughtful allocation of resources and serve a maximum number of users. First, we study the problem of network selection using the decision-making strategy MADM (Multi-Criteria Decision Making). It consists of choosing the best network according to several criteria using a batch of weights generated with the AHP method. We propose, therefore, a weight improvement based on fuzzy logic, FAHP. In order to take into account the speed of mobile users, we propose a context-aware network selection based on a new utility function that takes into account the user's preferences and the quality of service requirements in a high mobility scenario. We also improve the latter solution by proposing a network selection algorithm that provides a load balancing technique based on matching game theory to overcome network overload conditions in high-speed scenarios. In the second part, the performance study has been evaluated for two scenario types: Cellular and Vehicular. The proposed algorithms were evaluated and validated in both mobile and vehicular environments using the NS3 simulator.},

  abstract = {Along with the rapid growth of mobile broadband traffic, multiple radio access technologies (RATs) are being integrated and jointly managed. To optimize heterogeneous network performance, efficient Common Radio Resource Management (CRRM) mechanisms need to be defined. This paper tackles the access technology selection — a key CRRM functionality — and proposes a hybrid approach that combines benefits from both network-centric and user-centric methods. Network information, that is periodically broadcasted, assists mobile users in their decisions. By broadcasting appropriate decisional information, the network tries to globally control users decision in a way to meet operator objectives. On the other hand, mobiles also integrate their needs and preferences to select their access technology so as to maximize their own utility. In comparison with other RAT selection techniques, including network-centric, hybrid and user-centric methods, simulation results prove the efficiency of our hybrid approach in enhancing resource utilization and maximizing user satisfaction.},

Consequently, a considerable number of applications never seen before is emerging to make daily lifestyle more practical and connected through sharing, storing and processing personal data. When applied to industry, the same technologies can cause a real revolution in the manner how the information is treated. The value of the processed data is increasing fast and point to the fourth industrial revolution, or industry 4.0. This paper evaluates the performance of two ICT (Information and Communication Technology) protocols coming from the consumer world with an enormous potential to be used by industry. Experiments were performed to measure the round trip time using MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) and WebSocket protocols with the exchange of data between one server in Italy and another in Brazil. The results can be analyzed for each possible application and different network paths. The average latency samples using each of the protocols were similar, defining the payload size of the requests, but changing according to the way.},

  abstract = {Recently, various types of services belonging to different domains intertwine together and constitute the Big Service. In the Big Service and Internet of Things, services optimal composition is a key technology to create value-added services to satisfy users’ complex requests. However, massive services that possess the same functionalities but different quality of service (QoS) are emerging on the internet. Moreover, the online performance of many online services is determined by their distribute resources. Therefore, the expected performance of a composite service depends on the creation of the optimal composite service that can meet end-to-end quality requirements while ensuring that component services have sufficient resources to support their successful execution. To this end, resource and QoSaware services optimal composition (RQ-SOC) becomes an important issue in the Big Service and Internet of Things. Moreover, with the evolution of service industries, service features in various service domains (SFSD) (priori features, correlation features and similarity features) are gradually formed. These SFSD have great influences on RQ-SOC. Thus, to effectively solve the RQ-SOC problem, this paper first defines the SFSD and describes the important influences of SFSD on RQ-SOC. Then, the improved artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) for RQ-SOC is proposed, and a resource checking operator based on the analysis of the mutual relations between services and resources is presented. Third, the resources checking operator is integrated into the improved ABC to solve the RQ-SOC problem effectively. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed method for RQ-SOC is feasible and effective.},

By integrating air sensor and Raspberry Pi as data processor and using LoRa module as transceiver module, then the process of transmitting data from transmitter to receiver can be done directly without connected internet. In a test, the system can transmit intensity data information by wireless system on Line Of Sight (LOS) scemes at a maximum distance of 1.7 Km and Non Line Of Sight (NLOS) scheme at a distance of 400 meters with a average delay is 2 second.},

  abstract = {The fundamental properties of long-range (LoRa) performance have been revealed by previous research, but advanced issues remain unresolved. This paper tackles three technical challenges that are confronted when establishing a LoRa network on a smart energy campus testbed in Korea. First, the communication range of LoRa in a combined indoor and outdoor environment has yet to be determined. To address this problem, this study builds a LoRa testbed from which we measure the propagation properties of radio signals in a combined environment. Then, we establish a simplified path loss model for LoRa PHY and compute the communication range. Next, national regulations enforce the use of the Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) scheduling scheme, but its performance has never been examined. This paper enumerates the impacts of LBT, threshold values, back-off algorithms, and application parameters on LoRa Medium Access Control (MAC) performance. Last, the application parameters required by the smart energy scenario influence LoRa performance, but their impacts have been scarcely reported. Based on the application parameters and experimental results, this paper proposes a strategy to deploy LoRa gateway(s) and nodes on the campus. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first work that considers performance issues when establishing a LoRa network on a real-world application testbed.},

  abstract = {LoRa technology has emerged as an interesting solution for Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) applications. The main LPWA research directions are about large scale networks to support massive number of devices, interference issues, link optimization and adaptability. Thus heterogeneous network deployments and Spreading Factor (SF) allocation strategies need to be studied. In this paper, we investigate the performance of homogeneous networks (i.e. when all the nodes select the same LoRa configuration) and heterogeneous networks (i.e. when each node selects its LoRa configuration according to its link budget or their needs) for large scale deployments (up to 10000 nodes per gateway). For that purpose we have developed a LoRa Module, based on improved WSNet simulator, including a spectrum usage abstraction, the co-channel rejection due to the quasi-orthogonality of SFs and the gateway capture effect. Simulation results show the performance comparison in terms of reliability, network capacity and power consumption for homogeneous and heterogeneous deployments as a function of the number of nodes and the traffic intensity. The comparison shows the benefits of the heterogeneous deployment where each node selects its configuration according to its link budget.},

One of the major drawbacks of LoRa is the data latency and the traffic congestion when the number of devices in the network increases. Especially, the latency arises due to the extreme duty cycling of LoRa end-nodes for reducing the overall energy consumption. To overcome this drawback, we propose a heterogeneous network architecture and an energy-efficient On-demand TDMA communication scheme improving both the device lifetime and the data latency of standard LoRa networks. We combine the capabilities of microwatt wake-up receivers to achieve ultra-low power states and pure asynchronous communication together with the long-range connectivity of LoRa. Experimental results show a data reliability of 100 \% and a round-trip latency on the order of milliseconds with end devices dissipating less than 46 mJ when active and 1.83 µW during periods of inactivity, lasting up to 3 years on a 1200 mA h Lithium battery.},

  abstract = {LoRa is a low-power long-range IoT standard that uses the chirp spread spectrum technique, and we have strived to further extend its coverage by utilizing the direct device-to-device (D2D) links to construct a multi-hop relay network. In LoRa, the spreading factor (SF) is an important parameter, which not only provides great flexibility between the data rate and sensitivity but also presents a new dimension for multiple accesses. Our approach to improving the capacity of a multihop LoRa network is to attempt to off-load the data traffic into several subnets by utilizing this multiple-access dimension. Each subnet rooted at a sink node is allocated a specific SF on the basis of network clustering. This enables packet transmission in parallel with multiple SFs to become feasible. To allow such parallel transmissions, our considerations are: 1) ensuring the connectivity of all subnets; 2) off-loading the traffic according to the number of nodes, data rates, and network topologies of each subnet; and 3) shortening the airtime of each subnet by reducing the hop count. Toward these objectives, we present a tree-based SF clustering algorithm (TSCA) to conduct SF allocation in a multihop LoRa network. The TSCA focuses on balancing the airtime between the subnets while ensuring connectivity. Furthermore, we use simulations to show that our approach can significantly increase the network performance compared with other approaches. We additionally deploy a real-chip experiment to evaluate the feasibility of parallel transmission in practice.},

This bound matches the lower bound of Mannor and Tsitsiklis (2004) up to constants. We also devise action elimination procedures in reinforcement learning algorithms. We describe a framework that is based on learning the confidence interval around the value function or the Q-function and eliminating actions that are not optimal (with high probability). We provide a model-based and a model-free variants of the elimination method. We further derive stopping conditions guaranteeing that the learned policy is approximately optimal with high probability. Simulations demonstrate a considerable speedup and added robustness over 2-greedy Q-learning.},

For the adversarial multi-armed bandit problem, where the sequence of rewards is chosen by an oblivious adversary, the notion of best arm during the time horizon is too restrictive for applications such as ad-serving, where the best ad could change during time range. In this paper, we consider a variant of the adversarial multi-armed bandit problem, where the time horizon is divided into unknown time periods within which rewards are drawn from stochastic distributions. During each time period, there is an optimal arm which may be different from the optimal arm at the previous time period. We present an algorithm taking advantage of the constant exploration of EXP3 to detect when the best arm changes. Its analysis shows that on a run divided into N periods where the best arm changes, the proposed algorithms achieves a regret in O(N √T log T).},

  title = {Stochastic {{Multi}}-{{Armed}}-{{Bandit Problem}} with {{Non}}-Stationary {{Rewards}}},
  abstract = {In a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem a gambler needs to choose at each round of play one of K arms, each characterized by an unknown reward distribution. Reward realizations are only observed when an arm is selected, and the gambler’s objective is to maximize his cumulative expected earnings over some given horizon of play T . To do this, the gambler needs to acquire information about arms (exploration) while simultaneously optimizing immediate rewards (exploitation); the price paid due to this trade off is often referred to as the regret, and the main question is how small can this price be as a function of the horizon length T . This problem has been studied extensively when the reward distributions do not change over time; an assumption that supports a sharp characterization of the regret, yet is often violated in practical settings. In this paper, we focus on a MAB formulation which allows for a broad range of temporal uncertainties in the rewards, while still maintaining mathematical tractability. We fully characterize the (regret) complexity of this class of MAB problems by establishing a direct link between the extent of allowable reward “variation” and the minimal achievable regret, and by establishing a connection between the adversarial and the stochastic MAB frameworks.},

We first study the unique best arm setting when there exists one unique best arm. Second, we study the general switching best arm setting when a best arm switches at some unknown steps. For both settings, we target problem-dependent bounds, instead of the more conservative problem-free bounds. We consider two classical problems: (1) identify a best arm with high probability (best arm identification), for which the performance measure by the sample complexity (number of samples before finding a near-optimal arm). To this end, we naturally extend the definition of sample complexity so that it makes sense in the switching best arm setting, which may be of independent interest. (2) Achieve the smallest cumulative regret (regret minimization) where the regret is measured with respect to the strategy pulling an arm with the best instantaneous mean at each step.},

In this paper the use of a LoRa technology, originally developed for IoT, is investigated with the aim of implementing distributed measurement systems. After the conclusion that LoRa (Long Range) and LoRaWAN (LoRa Wide Area Network) architectures show a good match with measurement systems, the paper focuses on the characterization of time related performance indicators that are important for distributed systems. The experimental results show: the capability of low cost transceiver to schedule the transmission of frames with a standard uncertainty less than 3 µs; and an acceptable long term clock stability (Allan Deviation) of commercial available devices (nodes and packet forwarders) for application like smart metering, structural health monitoring and process industry.},

This aggravates the already over-congested unlicensed radio bands, calling for new mechanisms to improve spectrum management and energy efficiency, such as transmission power control. Existing protocols are based on simplistic heuristics that often approach interference problems (i.e., packet loss, delay and energy waste) by increasing power, leading to detrimental results. The scope of this work is to investigate how machine learning may be used to bring wireless nodes to the lowest possible transmission power level and, in turn, to respect the quality requirements of the overall network. Lowering transmission power has benefits in terms of both energy consumption and interference. We propose a protocol of transmission power control through a reinforcement learning process that we have set in a multi-agent system. The agents are independent learners using the same exploration strategy and reward structure, leading to an overall cooperative network. The simulation results show that the system converges to an equilibrium where each node transmits at the minimum power while respecting high packet reception ratio constraints. Consequently, the system benefits from low energy consumption and packet delay.},

It is shown that subject to the channel composition and application requirements, a single cell may include several millions of devices. Also, we show that the capacity of the uplink channel available to a LoRaWAN node strongly depends on the distance from the base station and does not exceed 2 kbit/s.

  abstract = {Long range low power is a family of technologies promising to connect thousands of sensors to the future internet of things. Within this family of possible technology choices, two different branches have emerged: the standards based on spreaded wideband communication and the standards based on narrowband communication, both promising to reach long range connectivity at very low power. More specifically, this paper focuses on chirp spread spectrum (CSS). This paper presents a detailed model of CSS, showing that the symbols are not perfectly orthogonal. The results show the potential communication ranges are close to narrowband networks and the robustness against interfering signals is 22 dB better for spreading factor 10 than BPSK. Although wideband communication is robust to interference, in long range communication, this robustness is insufficient due to the long range and the larger footprint. The large propagation losses due to the long range and the larger footprint make CSS prone to collisions with other noise sources, possibly larger than the coding gain.},

In this paper, we focus on the MAC layer of the recent LoRaWAN (long-range wide area network) standard, and specifically on the on-the-air activation procedure, which defines how nodes join an existing network. We propose a Markov chain model of the on-the-air activation, and we derive the expected delay and the expected energy required to join the network. We analyze the impact of several parameters on these metrics, including traffic conditions, duty cycles, and channel availability. We also discuss the impact of the regional settings of the standard. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first analysis of the MAC layer of LoRaWAN.},

In this paper, the technical differences between a wideband spread spectrum (LoRa-like) and an ultra narrowband (Sigfox-like) network will be explained and evaluated. On the physical layer, simulation results show that an ultra narrowband network has a larger coverage, while wideband spread spectrum networks are less sensitive to interference. When considering the contention between nodes and interference between different networks, simulations show that adaptation of frequency and modulation is imperative for efficiently dealing with varying contention and interference in long range unlicensed networks. Depending on network load, size and distance, a device in a wideband network can send 6 times more packets to the base station when there is active rate and frequency management and an intra-technology control plane.},

  abstract = {Up to recently, two main approaches were used for connecting the "things" in the growing Internet of Things (IoT) - one based on multi-hop mesh networks, using short-range technologies and unlicensed spectrum, and the other based on long-range cellular network technologies using corresponding licensed frequency bands. New type of connectivity used in LowPower Wide Area networks (LPWAN), challenges these approaches by using low-rate long-range transmission technologies in unlicensed sub-GHz frequency bands. In this paper, we do performance testing on one such star-topology network, based on Semtech’s LoRaTM technology, and deployed in the city of Rennes - LoRa FABIAN. In order to check the quality of service (QoS) that this network can provide, generally and in given conditions, we conducted a set of performance measurements. We performed our tests by generating and then observing the traffic between IoT nodes and LoRa IoT stations using our LoRa FABIAN protocol stack. With our experimental setup, we were able to generate traffic very similar to the one that can be used by real application such as sensor monitoring. This let us extract basic performance metrics, such as packet error rate (PER), but also metrics related specifically to the LoRa physical layer, such as the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and Signal to Noise ratio (SNR), within various conditions. Our findings provide insight about the performance of LoRa networks, but also about evaluation methods for these type of networks. We gathered measurement data that we make freely available together with the tools we used.},

For IoT, low power consumption and wide area coverage for end devices (ED) are important figures of merit, for which LoRa, SigFox and Narrow Band-IoT are dominant technologies. In this letter, we analyze LoRa systems for increasing average system packet success probability (PSP) under unslotted ALOHA random access protocol. The lower bound for average system PSP is derived when many contending EDs are transmitting by stochastic geometry. And it is shown that the average system PSP can be maximized by properly allocating an SF to each traffic, which also maximizes connectivity of EDs. We formulate an optimization problem for maximizing the average system PSP to propose a sub-optimal SF allocation scheme to each traffic. Analysis on PSP is validated through simulations, and comparison with existing schemes reveals that our proposed scheme achieves the highest PSP and so the maximum connectivity.},

First, the LoRaWAN technology is assessed experimentally through a set of laboratory and on-field tests, to characterize it from the link-level viewpoint; then, a system-level analysis is performed through simulation, to evaluate the capacity of a LoRaWAN gateway and a multigateway network to serve a large area. Finally, the results are discussed considering a broad set of use cases.},

To validate the module, we compare its results with measurements on a real-world testbed and with measured values reported by other work. We also show that the module correctly represents the capture effect that lowers the packet drop rate due to collisions. Second, we want to improve the performance of LoRa devices while not impacting energy consumption, the aspect that usually is not taken into account in the literature. We use the simulator to evaluate CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access), a simple enhancement to LoRaWAN that lowers the collision ratio. The simulation results show that CSMA considerably lowers the collision ratio while only slightly increasing energy consumption. We also observe that CSMA presents lower energy consumption than LoRa for a large number of devices. Another advantage of CSMA consists of increased throughput and larger network capacity because the ETSI restrictions on the duty cycle do not longer apply.},

  abstract = {The use of Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) is growing due to their advantages in terms of low cost, energy efficiency and range. Although LPWANs attract the interest of industry and network operators, it faces certain constraints related to energy consumption, network coverage and quality of service. In this paper we demonstrate the possibility to optimize the performance of the LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) technology, one of the most widely used LPWAN technology. We suggest that nodes use light-weight learning methods, namely, multi-armed bandit algorithms, to select the communication parameters (spreading factor and emission power). Extensive simulations show that such learning methods allow to manage the trade-off between energy consumption and packet loss much better than an Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) algorithm adapting spreading factors and transmission powers on the basis of Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) values.},

  abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the domain of physical/logical objects connected to the Internet that can be accessible anywhere and anytime, giving the access policies. Web objects and services can be seen as distributed and cooperative agents that need to collaborate in order to reach advanced functionalities and also to optimize the overall quality offered to the end users. However, the number of the services that can be supplied through these devices on the Internet will increase more and more. In this context, performing the composition and selection of the best services according to quality-of-service (QoS) criteria become a complex task, especially when dealing with global service selection to satisfy global constraints of users in decentralized environments. For this purpose, we propose a distributed and optimal QoS selection approach based on the multiagent paradigm and the distributed constraint optimization problem (DCOP) formalism. Hence, we revisited a DCOP technique for developing an efficient algorithm: the DPOP4QoS implemented under a real-time Web protocol for IoT communication, the extensible messaging and presence protocol. The proposed algorithm takes into account the specificities of the service composition context and the satisfaction of the global user constraints. This paper also presents a set of experiments conducted under realistic distributed environment to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.},

In emergency situations such as severe traffic accidents, minimizing the response time, which requires close collaborations between all stakeholders involved and distributed intelligence support, leads to greater survival chance of the injured. However, the current response system is far from efficient, despite the rapid development of information and communication technologies. This paper presents an automated collaboration framework for emergency management that coordinates all stakeholders within the emergency response system and fully automates the rescue process. Applying the concept of multiaccess edge computing architecture, as well as choreography of the service oriented architecture, the system allows seamless coordination between multiple organizations in a distributed way through standard web services. A service choreography is designed to globally model the emergency management process from the time an accident occurs until the rescue is finished. The choreography can be synthesized to generate detailed specification on peer-to-peer interaction logic, and then the specification can be enacted and deployed on cloud infrastructures.},

However QoS-aware management of service compositions is usually performed without considering service sharing. This simplifying assumption makes choreography deployment less feasible in real scenarios, in which a single service is typically shared in many scenarios. In this paper we discuss the problem of managing multiple choreographies in multi-cloud environments and we advocate that sharing-aware deployment is a more effective and resource-efficient approach. We propose a model for the combined deployment of multiple choreographies on top of a shared set of services, and we further investigate the problem through experiments.},

  abstract = {In the next-generation heterogeneous wireless networks, a mobile terminal with a multi-interface may have network access from different service providers using various technologies. In spite of this heterogeneity, seamless intersystem mobility is a mandatory requirement. One of the major challenges for seamless mobility is the creation of a network selection scheme, which is for users that select an optimal network with best comprehensive performance between different types of networks. However, the optimal network may be not the most reasonable one due to compensation of MADM (Multiple Attribute Decision Making), and the network is called pseudo-optimal network. This paper conducts a performance evaluation of a number of widely used MADM-based methods for network selection that aim to keep the mobile users always best connected anywhere and anytime, where subjective weight and objective weight are all considered. The performance analysis shows that the selection scheme based on MEW (weighted multiplicative method) and combination weight can better avoid accessing pseudo-optimal network for balancing network load and reducing ping-pong effect in comparison with three other MADM solutions.},

  abstract = {Due to the rapid growth of mobile data traffic, more and more basestations and access points (APs) have been densely deployed to provide users with ubiquitous network access, which make current wireless network a complex heterogeneous network (HetNet). However, traditional wireless networks are designed with network-centric approaches where different networks have different quality of service (QoS) strategies and cannot easily cooperate with each other to serve network users. Massive network infrastructures could not assure users perceived network and service quality, which is an indisputable fact. To address this issue, we design a new framework for heterogeneous wireless networks with the principle of user-centricity, refactoring the network from users’ perspective to suffice their requirements and preferences. Different from network-centric approaches, the proposed framework takes advantage of Software Defined Networking (SDN) and virtualization technology, which will bring better perceived services quality for wireless network users. In the proposed user-centric framework, control plane and data plane are decoupled to manage the HetNets in a flexible and coadjutant way, and resource virtualization technology is introduced to abstract physical resources of HetNets into unified virtualized resources. Hence, ubiquitous and undifferentiated network connectivity and QoE (quality of experience) driven fine-grained resource management could be achieved for wireless network users.},

First, we analyze LoRa modulation numerically and show that collisions between packets of different SFs can indeed cause packet loss if the interference power received is strong enough. Second, we validate such findings using commercial devices, confirming our numerical results. Third, we modified and extended LoRaSim, an open-source LoRa simulator, to measure the impact of inter-SF collisions and fading (which was not taken into account previously in the simulator). Our results show that non-orthogonality of the SFs can deteriorate significantly the performance especially of higher SFs (10 to 12) and that fading has virtually no impact when multiple gateways are available in space diversity.},

RIOT is a prominent free and open source operating system in this space. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive overview of RIOT. We cover the key components of interest to potential developers and users: the kernel, hardware abstraction, and software modularity, both conceptually and in practice for various example configurations. We explain operational aspects like system boot-up, timers, power management, and the use of networking. Finally, the relevant APIs as exposed by the operating system are discussed along with the larger ecosystem around RIOT, including development and open source community aspects.},

The data was collected during the cooperative platooning tests that took place in Helmond in the frame of the Grand Cooperative Driving Challenge 2016. In the competition, between 8-10 autonomous vehicles formed two platoons in different lanes and were required to merge into a predefined competition zone. The performance is characterized using CAM CCDFs which serves as a base for the evaluation of a Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control application. Two important effects has been identified that affect to the reliability of the communications. Firstly, there is a degradation with the distance that appears to be stronger for cars and more gentle for trucks. This indicates that occlusions heavily affect the connectivity of ITS-G5A. Secondly, the reliability is below expectations and some of the vehicles perform consistently worse than others. Although further investigation is required, a possible explanation for this is that a highly congested channel is making some of the vehicles get stuck and are not able to regularly access the channel.},

In contrast to conventional secure routing protocols in which a central authority (CA) is required to facilitate the identification and authentication of each device, the BCR protocol operates in a distributed manner with no CA. The BCR protocol utilizes smart contracts to discover a route to a destination or data gateway within heterogeneous IoT networks. Any intermediary device can guarantee a route from a source IoT device to a destination device or gateway. We compare the performance of BCR with that of the
              Ad-hoc
              On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol in a network of

  abstract = {The Internet of Things paradigm has brought opportunities to meet several challenges by interconnecting IoT resources, such as sensors, actuators, and gateways on a massive scale. The IoT gateways play an important role in the IoT applications to bridge between sensor networks and the external environment through the Internet. Typically, the IoT gateways collect and send the data collected from sensors and actuators to external platforms where they will be remotely analyzed. However, the users desire a more adapted IoT gateway that can improve the IoT data privacy preservation before sending them to these external platforms. Thus, an IoT gateway that enables a better control over the set of private IoT resources and protects the collected personal data and their privacy is required. For this purpose, we propose a Semantic IoT Gateway that helps implement a dynamic and flexible privacy-preserving solution for the IoT domain. First, it enables to match between the data consumer’s terms of service and the data owner’s privacy preferences by generating an adapted privacy policy. Second, it converts the privacy policy into a custom smart contract. Finally, it connects a set of private IoT resources to a distributed network using the blockchain technology to host the generated smart contracts. A smart contract is an executable code that runs on top of the blockchain to facilitate, execute and enforce an agreement between untrusted parties without the involvement of a trusted third party. Our proposal, which is highlighted through an example and experimentation on a real-world use-case, has given the expected results.},

When employing visual sensors in that scenario, still images and video streams may be retrieved from monitored areas, potentially providing valuable data for many applications. Actually, visual sensor networks may need to be highly dynamic, reflecting the changing of parameters in smart cities. In this context, characteristics of visual sensors and conditions of the monitored environment, as well as the status of other concurrent monitoring systems, may affect how visual sensors collect, encode and transmit information. This paper proposes a fuzzy-based approach to dynamically configure the way visual sensors will operate concerning sensing, coding and transmission patterns, exploiting different types of reference parameters. This innovative approach can be considered as the basis for multi-systems smart city applications based on visual monitoring, potentially bringing significant results for this research field.},

We report on data gathered with four capture devices from nearly 50 experimental runs conducted with vehicles on a rural highway. Our three primary contributions are: (1) We experimentally demonstrate that, on average, current protocols only achieve 50\% of the overall throughput possible in this scenario. In particular, even with a streamlined connection setup procedure that does not use DHCP, high packet losses early in a vehicular connection are responsible for the loss of nearly 25\% of overall throughput, 15\% of the time. (2) We quantify the effects of ten problems caused by the mechanics of existing protocols that are responsible for this throughput loss; and (3) We recommend best practices for using vehicular opportunistic connections. Moreover, we show that overall throughput could be significantly improved if environmental information was made available to the 802.11 MAC and to TCP. The central message in this paper is that wireless conditions in the vicinity of a roadside access point are predictable, and by exploiting this information, vehicular opportunistic access can be greatly improved.},

  abstract = {Routing algorithm is the key to prolong the lifetime of the overall wireless sensor network. At present, clustering routing algorithm is more widely used in wireless sensor networks. But this way of transmitting information through the cluster can lead to uneven energy consumption in the network, which is known as the “hot zone” problem. However, the uneven clusters, the way of multi-hop transmission between clusters can solve this problem. According to the characteristics of routing in wireless sensor network, this paper analyzes the defects and disadvantages of the current routing algorithm. This paper proposes a series of improvement measures for the current uneven clustering routing algorithm. This paper proposes a new algorithm which has a longer network life and better stability compared with the existing routing algorithm through experimental results and analysis.},

  abstract = {Billions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices are expected to populate our environments and provide novel pervasive services by interconnecting the physical and digital world. However, the increased connectivity of everyday objects can open manifold security vectors for cybercriminals to perform malicious attacks. These threats are even augmented by the resource constraints and heterogeneity of low-cost IoT devices, which make current host-based and static perimeter-oriented defense mechanisms unsuitable for dynamic IoT environments. Accounting for all these considerations, we reckon that the novel softwarization capabilities of Telco network can fully leverage its privileged position to provide the desired levels of security. To this aim, the emerging software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) paradigms can introduce new security enablers able to increase the level of IoT systems protection. In this paper, we design a novel policy-based framework aiming to exploit SDN/NFV-based security features, by efficiently coupling with existing IoT security approaches. A proof of concept test bed has been developed to assess the feasibility of the proposed architecture. The presented performance evaluation illustrates the benefits of adopting SDN security mechanisms in integrated IoT environments and provides interesting insights in the policy enforcement process to drive future research.},

The current LoRa technology provides a wide range of communication settings whereas many combination settings are orthogonal and, thus, they can be successfully decoded at the gateway when the signals are transmitted simultaneously. Previous simulation results showed that the LoRa network capacity can be improved when multiple communication parameters are applied. In this paper, we model a LoRa network consisting of nodes with different communication settings in terms of bandwidth and spreading factor. We compute the average success probability per configuration as a function of density taking into account both intra and inter-spreading factor collisions. We, also, formulate and solve an optimization problem to maximize the node capacity for a given deployment area and frequency by optimizing the number of nodes having different spreading factor configurations. We present numerical results and we show that solutions close to the optimal can increase the maximum number of nodes by more than 700\% compared to case where equal number of users per spreading factor are considered.},

  abstract = {Performing non-aggregate range queries on cloud stored data, while achieving both privacy and efficiency is a challenging problem. This paper proposes constructing a differentially private index to an outsourced encrypted dataset. Efficiency is enabled by using a cleartext index structure to perform range queries. Security relies on both differential privacy (of the index) and semantic security (of the encrypted dataset). Our solution, PINED-RQ develops algorithms for building and updating the differentially private index. Compared to state-ofthe-art secure index based range query processing approaches, PINED-RQ executes queries in the order of at least one magnitude faster. The security of PINED-RQ is proved and its efficiency is assessed by an extensive experimental validation.},

  abstract = {Long-range radio transmissions open new sensor application fields, in particular for environment monitoring. For example, the LoRa radio protocol enables connecting remote sensors at a distance as long as ten kilometers in a line-of-sight. However, the large area covered also brings several difficulties, such as the placement of sensing devices in regards to topology in geography, or the variability of communication latency. Sensing the environment also carries constraints related to the interest of sensing points in relation to a physical phenomenon. Thus, criteria for designs are evolving a lot from the existing methods, especially in complex terrains. This article describes simulation techniques based on geography analysis to compute long-range radio coverages and radio characteristics in these situations. As radio propagation is just a particular case of physical phenomena, it is shown how a unified approach also allows for characterizing the behavior of potential physical risks. The case of heavy rainfall and flooding is investigated. Geography analysis is achieved using segmentation tools to produce cellular systems which are in turn translated into code for high-performance computations. The paper provides results from practical complex terrain experiments using LoRa, which confirm the accuracy of the simulation, and scheduling characteristics for sample networks. Performance tables are produced for these simulations on current Graphics Processing Units (GPUs).},

  abstract = {Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) technologies such as Long Range (LoRa) are emerging that enable power efficient wireless communication over very long distances. LPWAN devices typically communicate directly to a sink node which removes the need of constructing and maintaining a complex multi-hop network. However, to ensure efficient and reliable communication LPWAN devices often provide a large number of transmission parameters. For example, a LoRa device can be configured to use different spreading factors, bandwidth settings, coding rates and transmission powers, resulting in over 6720 possible settings. It is a challenge to determine the setting that minimises transmission energy cost while meeting the required communication performance. This paper is the first to present a thorough analysis of the impact of LoRa transmission parameter selection on communication performance. We study in detail the impact of parameter settings on energy consumption and communication reliability. Using this study we develop a link probing regime which enables us to quickly determine transmission settings that satisfy performance requirements. The presented work is a first step towards an automated mechanism for LoRa transmission parameter selection that a deployed LoRa network requires, but is not yet specified within the Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) framework.},

These types of technologies provide the Internet of Things (IoT) devices with the ability to transmit few bytes of data for long ranges, taking into consideration minimum power consumption. In parallel, IoT applications will cover a wide range of human and life needs from smart environments (cities, home, transportation etc.) to health and quality of life. Among these popular LPWANs technologies, we have identified the unlicensed frequency band (LoRa, DASH7, SigFox, Wi-SUN, etc.), and the licensed frequency band standards (NB-IoT, LTE Cat-M, EC-GSM-IoT, etc.). In general, both types of standards only consider fixed interconnected things, and less attention has been provided to the mobility of the things or devices. In this paper, we address the mobility of the things and the connectivity in each of the three LPWAN standards: LoRaWAN, DASH7, and NB-IoT. In particular, we show how the mobility of things can be achieved when transmitting and receiving data. Then, we provide a general and technical comparison for the three standards. Finally, we illustrate several application scenarios where the mobility is required, and we show how to select the most suited standard. We also discuss the research challenges and perspectives.},

However, the limited bandwidth available for physical layer modulation in LoRa makes it unsuitable for high bit rate data transfer from devices like image sensors. In this paper, we propose a new method for mangrove forest monitoring in Malaysia, wherein we transfer image sensor data over the LoRa physical layer (PHY) in a node-to-node network model. In implementing this method, we produce a novel scheme for overcoming the bandwidth limitation of LoRa. With this scheme the images, which requires high data rate to transfer, collected by the sensor are encrypted as hexadecimal data and then split into packets for transfer via the LoRa physical layer (PHY). To assess the quality of images transferred using this scheme, we measured the packet loss rate, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and structural similarity (SSIM) index of each image. These measurements verify the proposed scheme for image transmission, and support the industrial and academic trend which promotes LoRa as the future solution for IoT infrastructure.},

LoRa, one of most prevalent long-range wireless communication technologies, can be used to underpin the development of smart cities. This study draws upon relevant research to gain an understanding of underlying principles and issues involved in the design and management of long-range and low-power networks such as LoRa. This research uses empirical evidence that has been gathered through experiments with a LoRa network to analyse network design and identify challenges and then proposes cost-effective and timely solutions. Particularly, practical measurements of LoRa network dependencies and performance metrics are used to support our proposals.

  abstract = {Knowing the heterogeneity of applications and services that need to to be supported in the internet of things (IoT), network slicing came out as a potential solution that virtually isolates 5G networks with various service requirements over a common physical network infrastructure. The latter needs to simultaneously support and isolate traffic issued from mobile and machine services which may require different needs in terms of reliability, latency, and bandwidth. In this paper, network slicing is investigated in LoRa networks over fixed and dynamic slicing strategies. The performance of LoRa slices is evaluated with different spreading factor (SF) configurations. Then, a dynamic inter-slicing algorithm is proposed based on a maximum likelihood estimation that avoids resource starvation and prioritizes a slice over another depending on its QoS requirements. Moreover, a novel intra-slicing strategy is proposed that maximizes resource allocation efficiency of LoRa slices with regard to their delay requirements. An energy module for LoRa in NS3 is also implemented to evaluate the energy consumption of devices in each slice. Simulation results performed in realistic LoRa scenarios highlight the utility of our proposition in improving QoS requirements of IoT devices and providing isolation between slices.},

The message delivery between participated nodes and gateway in the WSNs affects the quality of service (QoS) such as energy consumption and the successful delivery rate (SDR). In this paper, we present a novel packet transmission model for a smart wireless paging sensor network (WPSN) based on LoRaWAN, which supports a real-time elderly care application. The model is used to investigate the performance of star topology communication on elderly care via Markov discrete-time M/M/1 queuing system. The proposed traffic model enables the performance evaluation of WPSN for elderly care. Moreover, an optimal cluster allocation policy is proposed by which maximizing SDR are obtained and QoS constraint requirements are met in terms of energy consumption. We conduct analytic analysis and simulation to exploit the QoS of LoRa based WSNs for elderly care application. The proposed WPSN is experimental studied and validated in a real elder care scenario.

  abstract = {The performance of Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs), where LoRa networks are included, has spurred much interest in recent times due to the high interest in connecting more and more devices to the so-called Internet of Things (IoT). The massive number of connected devices associated to its random spatial deployment and random network access introduce new degrees of freedom, demanding for innovative performance evaluation approaches. In this paper we study the interference caused to a LoRa gateway due to the uplink transmissions of multiple coexisting LoRa devices. By admitting an uniform spatial distribution of the devices, we show that the aggregate interference caused to a LoRa gateway follows a nonGaussian distribution and its power can be approximated by a sum of independent non-identical gamma random variables. Our work adopts a typical LoRaWAN operating scenario where the transmissions of LoRa Class A devices are affected by path-loss, shadowing and Rayleigh fading. Numerical results obtained with the modeling methodology are compared with simulation results, and the validation of the proposed model is discussed for different transmission probabilities.},

Recently, both academia and industry are attracted to LoRaWAN because of its recent developments and applicability in the IoT environment. Mostly, the IoT concept involves massive end devices distributed over a wide topographical area, hence establishing a high density and large-scale environment. LoRaWAN makes use of six orthogonal spreading factors (SFs) in order to improve spectral efficiency and increase the capacity. In this paper, we focus on the LoRaWAN class A network end devices and the problem of network scalability under high-density urban environment by using both the confirmed and unconfirmed mode of communication. Simulation results show that the urban environment has a high impact on the distribution of SFs, thus leading to low network performance in terms of success ratio. We also observed that the use of acknowledgment limits the scalability of the LoRaWAN due to the duty cycle constraints. However, this study further reveals that elevating the antenna height can significantly improve the performance in an urban area.},

  abstract = {LoRa’s long-range and low-power features have made it an attractive candidate for IoT devices in various fields. In this work, we present an enhanced LoRaWAN protocol. LoRaWAN MAC protocol is characterized by the restrictive use of the channel, limited by the regulatory authorities to a 1\% duty cycle per cycle (i.e., 36 s per hour) per node. This regulation penalizes the nodes which require a channel access time greater than the limited duty cycle to occasionally transmit a large amount of data such as video surveillance or access control information in applications like smart school surveillance. However, some other nodes like environment sensors sharing a same LoRaWAN server may send very small amounts of information (e.g. temperature, humidity, ...) and under-use the authorized activity time of 1\% duty cycle. Hence the idea of implementing an activity time sharing mechanism among nodes that allows devices to borrow additional activity time from a device or set of devices that have completed the transmission of their packets and do not need the remaining time of the corresponding duty cycle. Our work extends and improves the activity time sharing mechanism initially proposed in [1]. Instead of FIFO sharing-time allocation based on a global activity time, which may lead to the starvation of the nodes that are others than that in the head of FIFO line, we propose a new time allocation algorithm based on the classification of the different requests according to their needs in terms of their QoS requirements. It allows to satisfy a larger number of nodes requiring extra time, with less control overheads while ensuring fairness. Our time-sharing algorithm has been implemented and tested on the wasp-mote chip of libelium, showing the performance improvement and its practical usability.},

While Byzantine fault-tolerant protocols mostly guarantee consistency (safety) in an asynchronous network using 3f +1 machines to overcome the simultaneous malicious failure of any f nodes, in many systems, e.g., blockchain systems, the number of available nodes (resources) is much more than 3f + 1. To utilize such extra resources, in this paper we introduce a model that leverages transaction parallelism by partitioning the nodes into clusters (partitions) and processing independent transactions on different partitions simultaneously. The model also shards the blockchain ledger, assigns different shards of the blockchain ledger to different clusters, and includes both intra-shard and cross-shard transactions. Since more than one cluster is involved in each cross-shard transaction, the ledger is formed as a directed acyclic graph.},

  title = {A {{Heuristic}}-{{Based Private Bitcoin Payment Network Formation Using Off}}-{{Chain Links}}},
  abstract = {While Bitcoin dominates the market for cryptocurrencies, its use in micropayments is still a challenge due to its long transaction validation times and high fees. Recently, the concept of off-chain payments is introduced that led to the idea of establishing a payment network called Lightning Network (LN). Off-chain links provide the ability to do transactions without writing to Blockchain. However, LN’s design still favors fees and is creating hub nodes that defeat the purpose of Blockchain. In addition, it is still not reliable as not all the transactions are guaranteed to be transmitted to their destinations. If current retailers would like to use it, these problems might hinder its adoption. To address this issue, in this paper, we advocate creating a private payment network among a given set of retailers that will serve their business needs, just like the idea of private Blockchains. The goal is to build a pure peer-to-peer topology that will eliminate the need for relays and increase the robustness of payments. Using off-chain links as edges and retailers as nodes, the problem is formulated as a multi-flow commodity problem where transactions represent the commodities from various sources to destinations. As the multi-flow commodity problem is NP-Complete, we propose a heuristic approach that utilizes Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm in a dynamic way by updating the edge weights when new payment paths are to be found. The order of transactions is randomized to provide fairness among the retailers. The evaluations indicate that the proposed heuristic comes close to an optimal solution while providing scalability and user privacy.},

  title = {Privacy-{{Preserving}} and {{Efficient Multi}}-{{Keyword Search}} over {{Encrypted Data}} on {{Blockchain}}},
  abstract = {Recent research has demonstrated searchable blockchains that not only provide reliable search over encrypted distributed storage systems but ensure privacy is preserved. Yet, current solutions focus on single-keyword search over encrypted data on the blockchain. To extend such approaches to multi-keyword scenarios, they essentially perform a singlekeyword search for multiple times and take the intersection of the results. However, such extensions suffer from privacy and efficiency issues. In particular, the service peers, which process the search requests, will be aware of the intermediate results, which include the data associated with each of the encrypted keywords. Moreover, these multiple traversals incur long delays in performing the search requests one after another with an extra cost in calculating the intersection of multiple sets. Finally, the service peers will charge the data owner a lot for writing the vast intermediate results to the smart contract. In this paper, we propose a bloom filter-enabled multi-keyword search protocol with enhanced efficiency as well as privacy preservation. In the protocol, a low-frequency keyword selected by a bloom filter will be used to filter the database when performing a multi-keyword search operation. Because the keyword is of low frequency, the majority of the data will be excluded from the result, which reduces the computational cost significantly. Moreover, we propose to use pseudorandom tags to facilitate completing each search operation in only one round. In this way, no intermediate results are generated, and the privacy is preserved. Finally, we implement the protocol in a local simulated blockchain network and conduct extensive experiments. The results indicate that our multi-keyword search protocol outperforms the traditional method with an average of 14.67\% less time delay and 59.96\% less financial cost.},

  abstract = {Blockchain has recently emerged as an important tool that can enable critical distributed applications without requiring centralized trust. For example, public blockchains have been used to enable many different cryptocurrencies. Unfortunately, existing public blockchains and smart contracts deployed on them may disclose sensitive information. Although there is some ongoing work that leverage advanced cryptography to address some of these sensitive information leakage issues, they require significant changes to existing and popular blockchains such as Ethereum and are usually computationally expensive. On the other hand, private blockchains have been proposed to allow more efficient and privacy-preserving data sharing among pre-approved group of nodes/participants. Although private blockchains address some of the privacy challenges by allowing sensitive data to be only seen by the select group of participants, they do not allow public accountability of transactions since transactions are approved by known set of users, and cannot be accessed publicly. Given these observations, one natural question that arise is, can we leverage both public and private blockchain infrastructures to enable efficient, privacy enhancing and accountable applications ? In this work, we try to address this challenge in the context of digital auctions.},

  abstract = {IoT devices produce a lot of valuable and sensitive data that is often shared with external parties to provide different kinds of useful services. Traditional IoT access control systems are centralized and do not include all the stakeholders in the access control decision making process. To fill this gap, we propose a permissioned blockchain based access control system for IoT where a different phase of access control like creating access policy and making the access control decision happens based on the consensus of all the stakeholders. To be more specific, we design and implement Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) in a permissioned blockchain called Hyperledger Fabric and leverage its smartcontract and distributed consensus to enable a distributed access control for IoT. The effectiveness of our proposed system is demonstrated by the performance evaluation result in an IoT testbed.},

  abstract = {Traceability and integrity are major challenges for the increasingly complex supply chains of today’s world. Although blockchain technology has the potential to address these challenges through providing a tamper-proof audit trail of supply chain events and data associated with a product lifecycle, it does not solve the trust problem associated with the data itself. Reputation systems are an effective approach to solve this trust problem. However, current reputation systems are not suited to the blockchain based supply chain applications as they are based on limited observations, they lack granularity and automation, and their overhead has not been explored. In this work, we propose TrustChain, as a three-layered trust management framework which uses a consortium blockchain to track interactions among supply chain participants and to dynamically assign trust and reputation scores based on these interactions. The novelty of Trustchain stems from: (a) the reputation model that evaluates the quality of commodities, and the trustworthiness of entities based on multiple observations of supply chain events, (b) its support for reputation scores that separate between a supply chain participant and products, enabling the assignment of product-specific reputations for the same participant, (c) the use of smart contracts for transparent, efficient, secure, and automated calculation of reputation scores, and (d) its minimal overhead in terms of latency and throughput when compared to a simple blockchain based supply chain model.},

The recent success of blockchain (BC) technologies and their applications in the Internet of Things (IoT) shed a light on this challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a Lightweight, Blockchain-based Privacy protection (Lib-Pri) scheme for surveillance cameras at the edge. It enables the VSS to perform surveillance without compromising the privacy of people captured in the videos. The Lib-Pri system transforms the deployed VSS into a system that functions as a federated blockchain network capable of carrying out integrity checking, blurring keys management, feature sharing, and video access sanctioning. The policy-based enforcement of privacy measures is carried out at the edge devices for real-time video analytics without cluttering the network.},

However, most of the existing blockchain networks are employed with the hashpuzzle-solving consensus protocol, known as proof-of-work. The competition of solving the puzzle introduces high latency, which directly leads to a long transaction-processing time. One solution of this dilemma is to establish a blockchain network with shards. In this paper, we focus on the blockchain network with shards and adopt the security-deposit based consensus protocol, studying the problem of how to balance the security incentive and the economic incentive. Also, the inherent features of the blockchain, i.e., anonymity and decentralization, introduce the information asymmetric issue between the beacon chain and the participants. The contract theory is utilized to formulate the problem between them. As such, the optimal rewards related to the different types of validators can be obtained, as well as the reasonable deposits accordingly. Compared with the fixed deposits, the flexible deposits can provide enough economic incentive for the participants without losing the security incentives. Besides, the simulation results demonstrate that the contract theory approach is capable of maximizing the beacon chain’s utility and satisfying the incentive compatibility and individual rationality of the participants.},

  abstract = {We introduce DaiMoN, a decentralized artificial intelligence model network, which incentivizes peer collaboration in improving the accuracy of machine learning models for a given classification problem. It is an autonomous network where peers may submit models with improved accuracy and other peers may verify the accuracy improvement. The system maintains an append-only decentralized ledger to keep the log of critical information, including who has trained the model and improved its accuracy, when it has been improved, by how much it has improved, and where to find the newly updated model. DaiMoN rewards these contributing peers with cryptographic tokens. A main feature of DaiMoN is that it allows peers to verify the accuracy improvement of submitted models without knowing the test labels. This is an essential component in order to mitigate intentional model overfitting by model-improving peers. To enable this model accuracy evaluation with hidden test labels, DaiMoN uses a novel learnable Distance Embedding for Labels (DEL) function proposed in this paper. Specific to each test dataset, DEL scrambles the test label vector by embedding it in a low-dimension space while approximately preserving the distance between the dataset’s test label vector and a label vector inferred by the classifier. It therefore allows proof-of-improvement (PoI) by peers without providing them access to true test labels. We provide analysis and empirical evidence that under DEL, peers can accurately assess model accuracy. We also argue that it is hard to invert the embedding function and thus, DEL is resilient against attacks aiming to recover test labels in order to cheat.

  title = {Remote {{Configuration}} of {{Integrated Circuit Features}} and {{Firmware Management}} via {{Smart Contract}}},
  abstract = {The cost to develop a new integrated circuit (IC), its fabrication, debug and volume production has been escalating with scaling of transistor feature size. According to an IBS report, the cost of developing a System on Chip (SoC) at 14nm may be as high as \$300 million [1]. The economics of semiconductor IC development favors high volume production, while high volume cannot be attained without developing an IC that serves a large number of applications. Some of these applications are in lowmargin Internet of Things (IoT) devices, where an SoC cannot command a high price. Consequently, without the ability to customize IC features after production, the price of an IC will be determined by its lowest priced application. This motivates the manufacturers to develop capabilities for post-production IC customization. The commodity microprocessor business offers an example of post-production customization, where a manufacturer can tailor cache size, number of cores and frequency of operation for a target market segment after a chip has been manufactured. Today, such customization is limited to one-time programming (OTP) for predetermined IC bins. In this paper, we explore how an IC can be programmed repeatedly and securely using a blockchain-based smart contract. This will enable users to upgrade IC features, or rent upgraded IC features for a fixed period after it has been purchased. The availability of such a system could, for example, allow a buyer to upgrade her processor from i3 to i5 after it has been purchased to scale to her computing needs in exchange of a payment made to the manufacturer. IC feature configuration is implemented by firmware updates from the manufacturer. The smart contract takes the feature configuration request from the IC as input and outputs the source of corresponding firmware. To support remote and authorized update by manufacturer, we propose an on-die hardware module that communicates with the smart contract and enforces its functionalities. Availability of this module also facilitates secure firmware update. The blockchain makes the update protocol secure and prevents users from obtaining unauthorized update.

In this paper, we propose a new framework named Sash that couples IoT platforms with blockchain that provides a number of advantages compared to state of the art. In Sash, the blockchain is used to store access control policies and take access control decisions. Therefore, both changes to policies and access requests are correctly enforced and publicly auditable. Further, we devise a “data marketplace” by leveraging the ability of blockchains to handle financial transaction and providing “by design” remuneration to data producers. Finally, we exploit a special flavor of identity-based encryption to cater for cryptography-enforced access control while minimizing the overhead to distribute decryption keys. We prototype Sash by using the FIWARE open source IoT platform and the Hyperledger Fabric framework as the blockchain back-end. We also evaluate the performance of our prototype and show that it incurs tolerable overhead in realistic deployment settings.},

However, the learning process of the existing federated learning platforms rely on the direct communication between the model owner, e.g., central cloud or edge server, and the mobile devices for transferring the model update. Such a direct communication may be energy inefficient or even unavailable in mobile environments. In this paper, we consider adopting the relay network to construct a cooperative communication platform for supporting model update transfer and trading. In the system, the mobile devices generate model updates based on their training data. The model updates are then forwarded to the model owner through the cooperative relay network. The model owner enjoys the learning service provided by the mobile devices. In return, the mobile devices charge the model owner certain prices. Due to the coupled interference of wireless transmission among the mobile devices that use the same relay node, the rational mobile devices have to choose their relay nodes as well as deciding on their transmission powers. Thus, we formulate a Stackelberg game model to investigate the interaction among the mobile devices and that between the mobile devices and the model owner. The Stackelberg equilibrium is investigated by capitalizing on the exterior point method. Moreover, we provide a series of insightful analytical and numerical results on the equilibrium of the Stackelberg game.},

  abstract = {With the increasing demand for the data-intensive wireless multimedia services over the time-varying wireless channels, the big-data based wireless networks demand the 5G candidate framework to process such massive amount of multimedia data without causing extra burden to the backhaul links in supporting the heterogeneous statistical delay-bounded quality-of-service (QoS) provisionings. Due to the benefits of energy harvesting (EH) technologies, wireless devices are able to support the dataintensive wireless multimedia services by harvesting energy from the environment. Energy harvesting has emerged as the promising technology to solve the energy supply problem while bringing new challenges due to the stochastic nature of the harvested energy in supporting the heterogeneous statistical quality-of-service (QoS) provisionings. However, due to the unknown dynamics of the harvested energy as well as the channel state information (CSI), it is challenging to design the efficient routing protocol for selecting the optimal routing and power allocation policies under the statistical delay-bounded QoS constraints. To overcome the aforementioned problems, in this paper we propose the Q-learning based optimal routing and power allocation policies through learning from the history of the energy harvesting process while satisfying the heterogeneous statistical delay-bounded QoS constraints over multihop big-data relay networks. In particular, under the heterogeneous statistical delay-bounded QoS requirements, we formulate the endto-end effective-capacity optimization problem for the batteryfree energy harvesting based big-data multihop relay networks. Then, we apply the Markov decision process and Q-learning methods for deriving the optimal multihop routing algorithms over big-data multihop relay networks. Also conducted is a set of simulations which evaluate the system performances and show that our proposed Q-learning based multihop routing scheme outperforms the other existing schemes under the heterogeneous statistical delay-bounded QoS constraints over multihop big-data relay networks.},

In this respect, this article extends that work identifying the most common IoT scenarios and their requirements to successfully achieve seamless cross-domain communication in IoT. Furthermore, an analysis of our architecture and the state-of-the-art network transition technologies is conducted on the basis of those requirements. Among other aspects, the analysis provides new insights of the shortcomings of our architecture. Based on these shortcomings, the article proposes new extensions of the architecture in order to achieve seamless communication across the most common IoT scenarios.},

  title = {A {{General Framework}} for {{Adjustable Neighbor Discovery}} in {{Wireless Sensor Networks}}},
  abstract = {Wireless sensor networks have been widely adopted in real-life applications. As one of the fundamental processes in constructing the network, neighbor discovery is to find out the existence of the nearby nodes. In order to enlarge the lifetime of each node, the nodes switch the radio OFF for most of the time, and only turn the radio ON for necessary communications. The fraction of time that the radio in ON is called duty cycle and low duty cycle schedule could help save energy. Most works focus on designing efficient discovery schedule under a pre-defined low duty cycle such that the neighboring nodes can discover each other in a short time. In this paper, we study a more practical problem where each node could adjust the duty cycle dynamically by the remaining energy or the subsequent tasks, which is referred to as adjustable neighbor discovery. We first propose a general framework to handle the problem, then present two distributed algorithms that can ensure the discovery between the neighboring nodes, no matter when they start and what duty cycle they choose. We also conduct simulations to evaluate the algorithms and the results corroborate our analyses.},

In this paper, a network slicing (NS) architecture based mobile edge computing (MEC) and software-defined network (SDN) technologies are proposed to support flexible 3C resource allocation for improving the service of three 5G typical usage scenarios, namely enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLC) and massive machine-type communications (mMTC). Furthermore, a neural network (NN) based 3C resource allocation algorithm is designed to provide resource allocation decision for the NS architecture. With the aid of data pre-processing techniques, fast resource allocation decisions can be made by the NN aided NS architecture. Meanwhile, the performance of the proposed NS architecture is investigated in a testbed environment. Experimental results obtained from the testbed demonstrate that the system performance of the NN aided NS architecture can be improved by function fitting based pre-processing approaches. Moreover, an accurate classification performance can be obtained by the proposed architecture for facilitating 3C resource allocations.},

  abstract = {A suitable environment for the growth of plants is the Greenhouse, that needs to be monitored by a continuous collection of data related to temperature, carbon dioxide concentration, humidity, illumination intensity using sensors, preferably in a wireless sensor network (WSN). Demand initiates various challenges for diversified applications of WSN in the field of IoT (Internet of Things). Network design in IoT based WSN faces challenges like limited energy capacity, hardware resources, and unreliable environment. Issues like cost and complexity can be limited by using sensors that are heterogeneous in nature. Since replacing or recharging of nodes in action is not possible, heterogeneity in terms of energy can overcome crucial issues like energy and lifetime. In this paper, an energy efficient routing process is discussed that considers three different sensor node categories namely normal, intermediate and advanced nodes. Also, the basic cluster head (CH) selection threshold value is modified considering important parameters like initial and residual energy with an optimum number of CHs in the network. When compared with routing algorithms like LEACH (Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy) and SEP (Stable Election Protocol), the proposed model performs better for metrics like throughput, network stability and network lifetime for various scenarios.},

Conventional Delay Tolerant Networks and opportunistic network methods and techniques however cannot be directly applied on smartphones. Challenges are brought up by missing ad-hoc communication possibilities and system architecture constraints. Through tethering hotspot-based communication it is possible to create opportunistic networks for smartphones, although with specific network characteristics. We conduct a survey on the impact of device characteristics and network transmission properties on the overall network performance. Using the ONE simulator, we deploy a tethering hotspot-based connection strategy and, as the main contribution of this paper, asses the influence of single device properties onto the global opportunistic network performance. By applying a Linear Regression, we conclude a device’s radio transmission range as the most significant factor one should consider when designing algorithms for smartphonebased opportunistic networks.},

Hence, applying SDN/NFV for IoT gateways is expected to ease the complexity of the interconnection into the edge network as well as facilitate the interconnection of multiple network protocols, and multiple co-existing tenants on the same physical network. In this paper, firstly, the authors investigate several popular IoT gateways such as NB-IoT and 6LoWPAN to propose a suitable SDN/NFV-based architecture for IoT networks. Secondly, P4 and ONOS controller are used to implement deep programming at the customer side of a network that is suitable for deploying massive IoT environments and developing their applications in the manner of horizontal scalability.

To analyze the service selection of the secondary transmitters, we formulate the problem as an evolutionary game. Specifically, we model the service adaptation of the secondary transmitters by the replicator dynamics, and analytically prove that a unique evolutionary equilibrium is reached by the evolutionary game. Also, we prove that the evolutionary equilibrium is stable. We further present numerical results to provide insights of the dynamic service selection in the network.},

  abstract = {As the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies permeate people’s daily lives, the sheer number of IoT applications has been developed to provide a wide range of services. Among all, real-time IoT services start to draw increasing attentions. Conventionally, cloud plays the role as the service provider in IoT but is no longer considered as the rational option for the real-time services due to service transmission latency and communication overhead. Therefore, we propose a novel rate-adaptive fog service delivery platform, namely RA-FSD, aiming at real-time service provisioning and network utility maximization (NUM) of the underlying IoT resources based on the newly emerged fog computing paradigm. The platform leverages fog nodes as either fog service provider to offer timely services for end users, or service intermediaries to help track network conditions and mitigate communication overhead. By doing so, service consumers would always benefit from the fact that services produced by IoT applications are in their proximity and thus delivered to destination in a prompt manner. A service rate-adaptive algorithm is also developed as the key component of the RA-FSD platform to handle the abrupt changes happened in IoT network, dynamically adjust service delivery rate based on the network condition while retaining satisfactory Quality of Service (QoS) to each service consumer, and support both elastic and inelastic network services from heterogeneous IoT applications.},

In this paper, we propose a new analytical framework, based on stochastic geometry theory, to model realistic RANs that leverage the business opportunities offered by network slicing. We mathematically prove the benefits of slicing radio access networks as compared to non-sliced infrastructures. Based on this, we design a new admission control functional block, STORNS, which takes decisions considering per slice SLA guaranteed average experienced throughput. A radio resource allocation strategy is introduced to optimally allocate transmit power and bandwidth (i.e., a slice of radio access resources) to the users of each infrastructure tenant. Numerical results are illustrated to validate our proposed solution in terms of potential spectral efficiency, and compare it against a non-slicing benchmark.},

Albeit the technology itself is quite mature and specified, how to effectively allocate wireless resources so as to support a large amount of devices in a same terrestrial area is an open challenge. This paper contributes by proposing two algorithms (of incremental complexity) which are shown to outperform the basic Adaptive Rate Strategy (ADR) so far considered. A first approach, named EXPLoRa-SF, shows the benefits of a simple strategy which does not limit to use (as per ADR) distance/RSSI measurements, but also selects Spreading Factors (SF) based on the total number of connected devices. The advantages attained with EXPLoRa-SF further lead us to propose a more sophisticated algorithm, named EXPLoRa-AT, which employs an innovative “ordered waterfilling” approach which attempts to allocate the spreading factors so as to equalize the Time on Air of the packets transmitted by the system’s end devices in each spreading factor’s group.

Together with the MAC layer solution LoRaWAN to realize IoT, they have attracted increasing attention from both industry and academia. In this work, we present our implemented LoRaWAN module for ns-3, to help boost the research in this rising area. Our implementation is compliant with the class A of the LoRaWAN 1.0 specification. It is highly configurable and thus can be easily used to exploit the impact of different parameters on LoRaWAN's performance. Our implemented flexible backbone architecture also allows for the easy integration of new protocols to improve the network performance. In the past two years, we have used this module to develop new protocols and algorithms to improve LoRaWAN's performance, in terms of reliability, capture effect, scalability, power consumption, among others. Our research outcomes have demonstrated the usefulness, flexibility, and configurability of the proposed LoRaWAN ns-3 module. We have made the source code of our module publicly available1.},

  doi = {10.1109/NOMS.2018.8406255},
  abstract = {Large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) deployments demand long-range wireless communications, especially in urban and metropolitan areas. LoRa is one of the most promising technologies in this context due to its simplicity and flexibility. Indeed, deploying LoRa networks in dense IoT scenarios must achieve two main goals: efficient communications among a large number of devices and resilience against dynamic channel conditions due to demanding environmental settings (e.g., the presence of many buildings). This work investigates adaptive mechanisms to configure the communication parameters of LoRa networks in dense IoT scenarios. To this end, we develop FLoRa, an open-source framework for end-to-end LoRa simulations in OMNeT++. We then implement and evaluate the Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) mechanism built into LoRa to dynamically manage link parameters for scalable and efficient network operations. Extensive simulations show that ADR is effective in increasing the network delivery ratio under stable channel conditions, while keeping the energy consumption low. Our results also show that the performance of ADR is severely affected by a highly-varying wireless channel. We thereby propose an improved version of the original ADR mechanism to cope with variable channel conditions. Our proposed solution significantly increases both the reliability and the energy efficiency of communications over a noisy channel, almost irrespective of the network size. Finally, we show that the delivery ratio of very dense networks can be further improved by using a network-aware approach, wherein the link parameters are configured based on the global knowledge of the network.},

  abstract = {Low power wide area networks are gaining interest to connect thousands of nodes to the internet of things. However, because the link budget in these networks is huge, nodes suffer from a near-far effect. Nodes far from the base station cannot send to the base station succesfully when closer nodes are transmitting, causing destructive collisions. LoRa, the considered technology in this paper, is a spread spectrum technology. It is known that spread spectrum is also sensitive to this effect. This paper presents a scheme to efficiently optimize the packet error rate fairness inside a LoRaWAN cell. This is achieved by optimizing the power and spreading factor for each node while avoiding near-far problems by allocating distant users to different channels. Simulations show that the packet error rate can be decreased up to 50\% for edge nodes in a moderate contention scenario where 1 node per 1000m2 transmits every 10 minutes.},

Most of the transmission technologies explicitly designed for IoT and machine-to-machine communication use either an ALOHA-based channel access or some type of Listen Before Talk strategy, based on carrier sensing. In this article, we provide a comparative overview of the uncoordinated channel access methods for Internet of Things technologies, namely ALOHA-based and Listen Before Talk schemes, in relation to the ETSI and FCC regulatory frameworks. Furthermore, we provide a performance comparison of these access schemes, in terms of both successful transmissions and energy efficiency, in a typical Internet of Things deployment. Results show that Listen Before Talk is effective in reducing inter-node interference even for long-range transmissions, although the energy efficiency can be lower than that provided by ALOHA methods. Furthermore, the adoption of rate adaptation schemes lowers the energy consumption while improving the fairness among nodes at different distances from the receiver. Coexistence issues are also investigated, showing that in massive deployments Listen Before Talk is severely affected by the presence of ALOHA devices in the same area.},

  abstract = {Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs) emerged to cover the needs of Internet of Things (IoT)-devices for operational longevity and long operating range. Among LPWANs, Long Range (LoRa) WAN has been the most promising; an upcoming IoT protocol, already adopted by big mobile operators like KPN and TTN. With LoRaWANs, IoT-devices transmit data to their corresponding gateways over many kilometers in a single hop and with 1\% duty-cycle. However, in a LoRa network, any device claims the channel for data-transmission without performing channel-sensing or synchronization with other devices. This increases humongously the number of collisions of information-packets when the number of IoT-devices that are connected per gateway increases. 
To improve the utilization of the channel, we propose the application of persistent-Carrier Sense Multiple Access (p-CSMA) protocols on the MAC layer of LoRaWANs. In this manuscript, we report on the initial design of a p-CSMA component for the simulation of LoRa networks in ns3. In particular, the classes adding p-CSMA functionality to the IoT-devices are presented. Additionally, the dependencies and relations between these classes and an existing LoRaWAN module on which they apply are detailed. Further, we evaluate this new p-CSMA LoRaWAN module in terms of Packet Reception Ratio (PRR) by simulating LoRa networks. The current report is the first step in the creation of a holistic p-CSMA module, directed to support network-researchers and connoisseurs in simulating all aspects of LoRa networks in ns3.},

The proposed model, furthermore, makes it possible to study the effect of different parameters configurations, thus offering a valid tool to investigate possible improvements to the system configuration. The proposed model is first validated by comparison with some accurate simulation results and, then, its potential is exemplified by analyzing the system settings that yield the best network performance.},

  abstract = {The need for low power, long range and low cost connectivity to meet the requirements of IoT applications has led to the emergence of Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) networking technologies. The promise of these technologies to wirelessly connect massive numbers of geographically dispersed devices at a low cost continues to attract a great deal of attention in the academic and commercial communities. Several rollouts are already underway even though the performance of these technologies is yet to be fully understood. In light of these developments, tools to carry out 'what-if analyses' and predeployment studies are needed to understand the implications of choices that are made at design time. While there are several promising technologies in the LPWA space, this paper specifically focuses on the LoRa/LoRaWAN technology. In particular, we present LoRaWANSim, a simulator which extends the LoRaSim tool to add support for the LoRaWAN MAC protocol, which employs bidirectional communication. This is a salient feature not available in any other LoRa simulator. Subsequently, we provide vital insights into the performance of LoRaWAN based networks through extensive simulations. In particular, we show that the achievable network capacity reported in earlier studies is quite optimistic. The introduction of downlink traffic can have a significant impact on the uplink throughput. The number of transmit attempts recommended in the LoRaWAN specification may not always be the best choice. We also highlight the energy consumption versus reliability trade-offs associated with the choice of number of retransmission attempts.},

  abstract = {With the development of new technologies, these last years have witnessed the emergence 26 of a new paradigm: the Internet of Things (IoT) and of the physical world. We are now able 27 to communicate and interact with our surrounding environment through the use of multi- 28 ple tiny sensors, RFID technologies or small wireless robots. This allows a set of new appli- 29 cations and usages to be envisioned ranging from logistic and traceability purposes to 30 emergency and rescue operations going through the monitoring of volcanos or forest fires. 31 However, all this comes with several technical and scientific issues like how to ensure the 32 reliability of wireless communications in disturbed environments, how to manage effi- 33 ciently the low resources (energy, memory, etc.) or how to set a safe and sustainable (both 34 hardware and software) platform maintenance. All these issues are addressed by research- 35 ers all around the world but solutions designed for IoT need to face real experimentations 36 to be validated. To ease such experimentations for IoT, several experimental testbeds have 37 been deployed offering diverse and heterogeneous services and tools. In this article, we 38 study the different requirements and features such facilities should offer. We survey the 39 different experimental facilities currently available for the community, describe their char- 40 acteristics. In particular, we detail the different hardware used for sensor networks and 41 robot platforms and the scope of services the different facilities offer with a specific focus 42 on testbeds which enable experimentations with mobility. We expect this survey assist a 43 potential user to easily choose the one to use regarding his own needs. Finally, we identify 44 existing gaps and difficulties and investigate new directions for such facilities.},

This facilitates the creation of smart strategies allowing monitoring and optimization as well as many other new use cases for various sectors. Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) have enormous potential as they are suited for various IoT applications and each LPWAN technology has certain features, capabilities and limitations. One of these technologies, namely LoRa/LoRaWAN has several promising features and private and public LoRaWANs are increasing worldwide. Similarly, researchers are also starting to study the potential of LoRa and LoRaWANs. This paper examines the work that has already been done and identifies flaws and strengths by performing a comparison of created testbeds. Limitations of LoRaWANs are also identified.},

Contrary to previous works, our methodology does not rely on localized and low-dimensional features, such as those extracted from the signal transient or preamble, but uses the entire signal. We have performed our experiments using 22 LoRa devices with 3 di erent chipsets. Our results show that identical chipsets can be distinguished with 59\% to 99\% accuracy per symbol, whereas chipsets from di erent vendors can be ngerprinted with 99\% to 100\% accuracy per symbol. e ngerprinting can be performed using only inexpensive commercial o -the-shelf so ware de ned radios, and a low sample rate of 1 Msps. Finally, we release all datasets and code pertaining to these experiments to the public domain.},

  abstract = {Despite the inaccessibility or intermittency of Internet in developing countries, it remains one of the key elements in the field of IoT and the smart city. Most cities experiencing these difficulties can, therefore, use stand-alone LoRaWAN base station solutions and provide good coverage of the area. Leftovers can claim to have access to acceptable connectivity, and therefore cheaper wireless communication, giving direct access to Internet from the collection node, will be required for data transmission: Wi-Fi can attain these objectives. In this article, we first examine the existing tools to ensure a good coverage study of the LoRaWAN network and, thus, perform a testBed. After, we offer a multi-optional architectural model that supports LoRaWAN and Wi-Fi protocols and that is flexible for other options. A gateway (Wi-IoT) capable of both providing Wi-Fi access and at the same time the ability to collect, process and monitor data as a mini-server will be proposed as proof of concept. From the node to the gateway, the data is compressed and sent securely and a user who connects to the gateway can, then, have access to the data.},

  abstract = {We present a complete simulation and experimentation framework for IEEE 802.11p. The core of the framework is an SDR-based OFDM transceiver that we validated extensively by means of simulations, interoperability tests, and, ultimately, by conducting a field test. Being SDR-based, the transceiver offers important benefits: It provides access to all data down to and including the physical layer, allowing for a better understanding of the system. Based on open and programmable hardware and software, the transceiver is completely transparent and all implementation details can be studied and, if needed, modified. Finally, it enables a seamless switch between simulations and experiments and, thus, helps to bridge the gap between theory and practice. Comparing the transceiver’s performance with independent results from simulations and experiments, we underline its potential to be used as a tool for further studies of IEEE 802.11p networks both in field operational tests as well as for simulation-based development of novel physical layer solutions. To make the framework accessible to fellow researchers and to allow reproduction of the results, we released it under an Open Source license.},

  title = {Bitcoin {{Mining}} with {{Transaction Fees}}: {{A Game}} on the {{Block Size}}},
  abstract = {In a Bitcoin market, miners participate in blockchain mining with an aim to make profits. Until reaching consensus, PoW-valid blocks (including validated transactions and proper PoW solutions) can be viewed as being successfully mined and are rewarded. There are two types of rewards for miners: fixed block subsidies and time-varying transaction fees. Block subsidies, predetermined by design, are the current major revenue source. Transaction fees, offered by Bitcoin transaction senders to accelerate their transactions, heavily depend on the corresponding transaction size. Thus, a larger-size block tends to contain higher transaction fees and hence more rewards. However, the probability of a miner to successfully mine a block diminishes as the block size increases, since a larger-size block takes a longer time to reach consensus. Thus, the reward included in the block is vitally affected by its size, which is independently decided by a miner. In this paper, we use a game-theoretic approach to study how a miner’s payoff, i.e., expected profits, is determined by his block size. More specifically, we derive an expression to characterize the relation between the miner’s payoff and block sizes. Besides, we use game theory to analyze how profit-driven miners will manipulate their block sizes to optimize payoff instead of adopting the default block size. We conduct numerical experiments on real-world data collected from Bitcoin to find peaceful equilibrium where miners have no incentive to misbehave. The achieved block sizes thereby give guidelines on the default block size, in order to deter miners from misbehaving. Our analysis suggests a block size of 4 MB.},

We consider the entire network energy while choosing the next hop for the routed packets in the targeted wireless sensor network. Our delivery approach considers resource limitations in terms of hop count, and remaining-energy levels. Extensive simulations are performed and achieved results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach in comparison to other baseline energy-aware routing protocols in the literature.},

  abstract = {Network slicing is one key enabler to provide the required flexibility and to realize the service-oriented 5G vision. Unlike the core network slicing, radio access network (RAN) slicing is still at its infancy and several works just start to investigate the challenges and potentials to enable the multi-service RAN, toward a serviced-oriented RAN (SO-RAN) architecture. One of the major concerns in RAN slicing is to provide different levels of isolation and sharing as per slice requirement. Moreover, both control and user plane processing may be customized allowing a slice owner to flexibly control its service. Enabling dynamic RAN composition with flexible functional split for disaggregated RAN deployments is another challenge. In this paper, we propose a RAN runtime slicing system through which the operation and behavior of the underlying RAN could be customized and controlled to meet slice requirements. We present a proof-ofconcept prototype of the proposed RAN runtime slicing system for LTE, assess its feasibility and potentials, and demonstrate the isolation, sharing, and customization capabilities with three representative use cases.},

  abstract = {Software Defined Networking (SDN) decouples the control plane from the data plane of forwarding devices. This separation provides several benefits, including the simplification of network management and control. However, due to a variety reasons, such as budget constraints and fear of downtime, many organizations are reluctant to fully deploy SDN. Partially deploying SDN through the placement of a limited number of SDN devices among legacy (traditional) network devices, forms a so-called hybrid SDN network. While hybrid SDN networks provide many of the benefits of SDN and have a wide range of applications, they also pose several challenges. These challenges have recently been addressed in a growing body of literature on hybrid SDN network structures and protocols. This article presents a comprehensive up-to-date survey of the research and development in the field of hybrid SDN networks. We have organized the survey into five main categories, namely hybrid SDN network deployment strategies, controllers for hybrid SDN networks, protocols for hybrid SDN network management, traffic engineering mechanisms for hybrid SDN networks, as well as testing, verification, and security mechanisms for hybrid SDN networks. We thoroughly survey the existing hybrid SDN network studies according to this taxonomy and identify gaps and limitations in the existing body of research. Based on the outcomes of the existing research studies as well as the identified gaps and limitations, we derive guidelines for future research on hybrid SDN networks.},

In recent years, this concept proves to be a promising solution for emergent enterprises. In this paper, we present a Content Delivery Network as a Service (CDNaaS) platform which can create virtual machines (VMs) through a network of data centers and provide a customized slice of CDN to users. CDNaaS manages a great number of videos by means of caches, transcoders, and streamers hosted in different VMs. However, an optimal placement of VMs with adequate flavors for the different images is required to obtain an efficient slice of CDN. In this work, we argue the need to find a convenient slice for the CDN owner while respecting his performance requirements and minimizing as much as possible the incurred cost. We first formulate the VMs placement problem as two Linear Integer problem solutions, aiming at minimizing the cost and maximizing the quality of experience of streaming. Then, extensive simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed models.},

With network slicing, service providers can provide a cost-efficient solution towards meeting diverse performance requirements of deployed applications and services. Despite slicing benefits, End-to-End orchestration and management of network slices is a challenging and complicated task. In this chapter, we intend to survey all the relevant aspects of network slicing, with the focus on networking technologies such as Software-defined networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) in 5G, Fog/Edge and Cloud Computing platforms. To build the required background, this chapter begins with a brief overview of 5G, Fog/Edge and Cloud computing, and their interplay. Then we cover the 5G vision for network slicing and extend it to the Fog and Cloud computing through surveying the state-of-the-art slicing approaches in these platforms. We conclude the chapter by discussing future directions, analyzing gaps and trends towards the network slicing realization.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, over-the-top (OTT) applications can be accessed via Internet connections over cellular networks. Mobile network operators (MNOs) strive to accommodate mobile traffic through energy efficient shared networks. The OTT service providers (OSPs) need to interact with MNOs and require resources for offering desired quality-of-service (QoS) levels to users of different categories, with different QoS requirements, which imply prioritization of certain OTT flows. Resource scheduling should respect network neutrality, which forbids OSP prioritization. Furthermore, OSPs request resources periodically, according to their performance goals, causing delay in flows’ accommodation due to i) the time required for information exchange between OSPs and MNOs, affected by network congestion, and ii) the time required for flows to receive resources, affected by the number of active flows. The intervention of OSPs may induce additional energy cost for the MNOs and affect the mobile network energy efficiency. Acknowledging the lack of OSP-oriented resource management approaches, we introduce a matching theoretic flow prioritization (MTFP) algorithm and investigate delay and energy efficiency through extensive simulations. Our study shows that MTFP improves both metrics comparing to the best effort approach, whereas its performance is affected by the OTT traffic level and the frequency of resource allocation process.},

More and more vertical industries need their machines and devices connected in networks with specific requirements. In order to provide networks fitted to these usecases, and not require that they adapt to the one-size-fits-all network as is currently the case with the mobile Internet, the telecom community vowed to include network slicing functionality within its next generation of mobile networking, 5G, as an end-to-end network solution. As the concept is new and still not fully grasped, we develop and refine the concept of a network slice both from a business and a technological point of view. We investigate how network slicing in the context of a vehicular network could be implemented and how it advances the state of the art. This involves a detailed study of the involved technologies across a range of infrastructures and network segments, as well as the resulting gaps in the existing technology landscape. Based on the lessons learned in this concrete usecase, network slicing is considered in a broader 5G landscape. We capture the main challenges and potential directions in order to make network slicing a true enabler of 5G-driven vertical industries.},

  abstract = {Network slicing is designed to support a variety of emerging applications with diverse performance and flexibility requirements, by dividing the physical network into multiple logical networks. These applications along with a massive number of mobile phones produce large amounts of data, bringing tremendous challenges for network slicing performance. From another perspective, this huge amount of data also offers a new opportunity for the management of network slicing resources. Leveraging the knowledge and insights retrieved from the data, we develop a novel Machine Learning-based scheme for dynamic resource scheduling for networks slicing, aiming to achieve automatic and efficient resource optimisation and End-to-End (E2E) service reliability. However, it is difficult to obtain the userrelated data, which is crucial to understand the user behaviour and requests, due to the privacy issue. Therefore, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is leveraged to extract knowledge from experience by interacting with the network and enable dynamic adjustment of the resources allocated to various slices in order to maximise the resource utilisation while guaranteeing the Quality-of-Service (QoS). The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed resource scheduling scheme can dynamically allocate resources for multiple slices and meet the corresponding QoS requirements.},

  abstract = {The notions of softwarization and virtualization of the radio access network (RAN) of next-generation (5G) wireless systems are ushering in a vision where applications and services are physically decoupled from devices and network infrastructure. This crucial aspect will ultimately enable the dynamic deployment of heterogeneous services by different network operators over the same physical infrastructure. RAN slicing is a form of 5G virtualization that allows network infrastructure owners to dynamically “slice” and “serve” their network resources (i.e., spectrum, power, antennas, among others) to different mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), according to their current needs. Once the slicing policy (i.e., the percentage of resources assigned to each MVNO) has been computed, a major challenge is how to allocate spectrum resources to MVNOs in such a way that (i) the slicing policy defined by the network owner is enforced; and (ii) the interference among different MVNOs is minimized. In this article, we mathematically formalize the RAN slicing enforcement problem (RSEP) and demonstrate its NP-hardness. For this reason, we design three approximation algorithms that render the solution scalable as the RSEP increases in size. We extensively evaluate their performance through simulations and experiments on a testbed made up of 8 software-defined radio peripherals. Experimental results reveal that not only do our algorithms enforce the slicing policies, but can also double the total network throughput when intra-MVNO power control policies are used in conjunction.},

In an Internet of Things (IoT) context, network resources need to be efficiently reserved and assigned for IoT devices in an isolated manner to handle and support specific Quality of Service (QoS) requirements for each slice. The focus of this paper is to investigate network slicing in LoRa network and propose a dynamic inter-slicing algorithm based on a maximum likelihood estimation that avoids resource starvation and prioritizes a slice over another depending on its QoS requirements. Moreover, we place the emphasis on a novel intra-slicing strategy that maximizes resource allocation efficiency of LoRa slices with regard to their delay requirements. After integrating an energy module for LoRa in NS3, simulation results performed in realistic LoRa scenarios highlight the utility of our dynamic network slicing proposition in providing isolation between slices with specific QoS guarantees.},

The increasing complexity in HMNs renders the control and coordination of networks a challenging task. The control frameworks of current cellular networks, which were previously designed for sparse network deployment, hit the wall for HMNs. HMNs need good separation of control and data planes, and call for novel control methods to handle the highly complex dynamics therein. In this article, we first briefly review the control planes of 2G to 4G cellular networks, and then identify their constraints to support HMNs. We analyze the complexity in HMNs and examine enabling control technologies for HMNs. We believe new thinking is needed for efficient control of HMNs. SDN is a promising technology to solve complex control problems in the Internet. Principle-based control methods applied in SDN are promising to solve control problems in HMNs. Several SDN approaches have been proposed for mobile networks. However, most of them are targeted at mobile core networks. We propose an SDNbased control framework named SoftMobile to coordinate complex radio access in HMNs. The main features of SoftMobile are low-layer abstraction, separation of control and data planes, and network-wide high-layer programmable control. Important research problems in SDN for mobile networks are highlighted. We believe SDN for mobile networks will be the controlling evolution of future HMNs.},

The framework of the network slicing scheme consists of an upper-level, which manages admission control, user association and baseband resource allocation; and a lower-level, which performs radio resource allocation among users. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve a higher network throughput, fairness and QoS performance compared to several baseline schemes.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a dynamic radio resource slicing framework is presented for a two-tier heterogeneous wireless network (HetNet). Through software-defined networking (SDN)enabled wireless network function virtualization (NFV), radio spectrum resources of heterogeneous wireless networks are partitioned into different bandwidth slices for different base stations (BSs). This framework facilitates spectrum sharing among heterogeneous BSs and achieves differentiated quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning for data service and machine-to-machine (M2M) service in the presence of network load dynamics. To determine the set of optimal bandwidth slicing ratios and optimal BS-device association patterns, a network utility maximization problem is formulated with the consideration of different traffic statistics and QoS requirements, location distribution for end devices, varying device locations, load conditions in each cell, and inter-cell interference. For tractability, the optimization problem is transformed to a biconcave maximization problem. An alternative concave search (ACS) algorithm is then designed to solve for a set of partial optimal solutions. Simulation results verify the convergence property and display low complexity of the ACS algorithm. It is demonstrated that the proposed radio resource slicing framework outperforms the two other resource slicing schemes in terms of low communication overhead, high spectrum utilization, and high aggregate network utility.},

Therefore, network slicing will provide the required design flexibility. Radio resource slicing would be an indispensable component of any network slicing solution. This paper proposes Hap-SliceR, which is a novel radio resource slicing framework for 5G networks with haptic communications. First, Hap-SliceR derives a network-wide radio resource slicing strategy for 5G networks. The optimal slicing strategy, which is based on a reinforcement learning approach, allocates radio resources to different slices while accounting for the dynamics and utility requirements of different slices. Second, Hap-SliceR provides customization of radio resources for haptic communications over 5G networks. The radio resource allocation requirements of haptic communications have been translated into a unique radio resource allocation problem. A low-complexity heuristic algorithm has been developed for resource allocation. Finally, a comprehensive performance evaluation of Hap-SliceR has been conducted based on a recently proposed 5G air-interface design.},

  abstract = {With the development of smart mobile devices and various mobile applications, content-oriented service has become the most popular service which occupies network resources and results in high traffic load. In order to improve quality of experience in radio access network and reduce the OpEx and CapEx of operators, wireless network virtualization and network slicing come into the vision and are deemed as promising solutions to radio access networks to provide tailored services. Therefore, network slicing and optimization based on content-oriented service become a challenging research direction. In this paper, network slicing and resource optimization on content-oriented application in cache-enabled hybrid radio access network based on complex network are investigated. A Cooperative Network Slicing Framework Based on Content in RAN (CNSC-RAN) is presented. Based on CNSC-RAN, procedures of content-oriented static network slicing and dynamic slicing are proposed. Content-oriented slicing is modeled and analyzed which includes slicing on content cache resources and communication resources. In order to obtain the optimized resources sliced for each content, the optimization problem is formulated to minimize the average system cost to get the contents required by users. The problem is solved by a heuristic algorithm called CCSOA (Content-Centric Slicing Optimization Algorithm) in a dynamic content-oriented network slicing procedure enabling UEs with self-evicting contents. The performance of CCSOA is evaluated by performance metrics including hit rate, average cache occupation, average system cost, and request traffic reduction to macro cell base station comparing with CEE and ProbCache. Simulation results reveal the effectiveness of CCSOA.},

The realization of network slicing is particularly challenging in the Radio Access Network (RAN) part, where multiple slices can be multiplexed over the same radio channel and Radio Resource Management (RRM) functions shall be used to split the cell radio resources and achieve the expected behaviour per slice. In this context, this paper describes the key design and implementation aspects of a Software-Defined RAN (SD-RAN) experimental testbed with slicing support. The testbed has been designed consistently with the slicing capabilities and related management framework established by 3GPP in Release 15. The testbed is used to demonstrate the provisioning of RAN slices (e.g. preparation, commissioning and activation phases) and the operation of the implemented RRM functionality for slice-aware admission control and scheduling.},

  abstract = {It is widely acknowledged that network slicing can tackle the diverse use cases and connectivity services of the forthcoming next-generation mobile networks (5G). Resource scheduling is of vital importance for improving resourcemultiplexing gain among slices while meeting specific service requirements for radio access network (RAN) slicing. Unfortunately, due to the performance isolation, diversified service requirements, and network dynamics (including user mobility and channel states), resource scheduling in RAN slicing is very challenging. In this paper, we propose an intelligent resource scheduling strategy (iRSS) for 5G RAN slicing. The main idea of an iRSS is to exploit a collaborative learning framework that consists of deep learning (DL) in conjunction with reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, DL is used to perform large time-scale resource allocation, whereas RL is used to perform online resource scheduling for tackling small time-scale network dynamics, including inaccurate prediction and unexpected network states. Depending on the amount of available historical traffic data, an iRSS can flexibly adjust the significance between the prediction and online decision modules for assisting RAN in making resource scheduling decisions. Numerical results show that the convergence of an iRSS satisfies online resource scheduling requirements and can significantly improve resource utilization while guaranteeing performance isolation between slices, compared with other benchmark algorithms.},

  abstract = {Network slicing in fog radio access networks (FRANs) is recognized as a cost-efficient solution to support future diverse use cases. However, with the number of user equipments (UEs) fast increasing, the centralized resource allocation architecture for network slicing can put heavy burdens on the global radio resource manager (GRRM), and meanwhile slice customization is not easy to achieve. To overcome the two issues, a hierarchical radio resource allocation architecture is proposed in this paper, where the GRRM is responsible for allocating subchannels to local radio resource managers (LRRMs) in slices, which then allocate the assigned resources to their UEs. Under this architecture, a hierarchical resource allocation problem is formulated, and the problem is further modeled as a Stakelberg game with the GRRM as the leader and LRRMs as followers, considering the hierarchy between the GRRM and LRRMs. Due to the NP-hardness of the followers’ problems, a process based on exhaustive search is first proposed to achieve the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE). Nevertheless, when the network scale is large, achieving SE within limited decision making time is impractical for game players. Facing this challenge, the GRRM and LRRMs are seen as bounded rational players, and low complexity algorithms are developed to help them achieve local optimal solutions that lead to a weak version of SE. Simulation results show that there exists a tradeoff between the performance of slices, and the low complexity algorithms achieve close performance to that of exhaustive search and outperform other baselines significantly.},

  abstract = {We consider the resource allocation for the virtualized OFDMA uplink cloud radio access network (C-RAN), where multiple wireless operators (OPs) share the C-RAN infrastructure and resources owned by an infrastructure provider (InP). The resource allocation is designed through studying tightly coupled problems at two different levels. The upper-level problem aims at slicing the fronthaul capacity and cloud computing resources for all OPs to maximize the weighted profits of OPs and InP considering practical constraints on the fronthaul capacity and cloud computation resources. Moreover, the lower-level problems maximize individual OPs’ sum rates by optimizing users’ transmission rates and quantization bit allocation for the compressed I/Q baseband signals. We develop a two-stage algorithmic framework to address this two-level resource allocation design. In the first stage, we transform both upper-level and lowerlevel problems into corresponding problems by relaxing underlying discrete variables to the continuous ones. We show that these relaxed problems are convex and we develop fast algorithms to attain their optimal solutions. In the second stage, we propose two methods to round the optimal solution of the relaxed problems and achieve a final feasible solution for the original problem. Numerical studies confirm that the proposed algorithms outperform two greedy resource allocation algorithms and their achieved sum rates are very close to sum rate upper-bound obtained by solving relaxed problems. Moreover, we study the impacts of different parameters on the system sum rate, performance tradeoffs, and illustrate insights on a potential system operating point and resource provisioning issues.},

We consider a criterion for dynamic resource allocation amongst tenants, based on a weighted proportionally fair objective, which achieves desirable fairness/protection across the network slices of the different tenants and their associated users. Several key properties are established, including: the Pareto-optimality of user association to base stations, the fair allocation of base stations’ resources, and the gains resulting from dynamic resource sharing across slices, both in terms of utility gains and capacity savings. We then address algorithmic and practical challenges in realizing the proposed criterion. We show that the objective is NP-hard, making an exact solution impractical, and design a distributed semi-online algorithm, which meets performance guarantees in equilibrium and can be shown to quickly converge to a region around the equilibrium point. Building on this algorithm, we devise a practical approach with limited computational information and handoff overheads. We use detailed simulations to show that our approach is indeed near-optimal and provides substantial gains both to tenants (in terms of capacity savings) and end users (in terms of improved performance).},

In this paper, we propose a flexible cloud-based radio access network (FRAN) for TI, where traffic of user equipments (UEs) can be temporary offloaded from the operator-provided networks to user-provided networks if needed. Such a concept enables dynamic network slicing (DNS) where the network architecture is temporally augmented with slices of infrastructure borrowed from user provided network. FRAN is able to support Tactile applications without any basic change to the hardware/software infrastructure in the network. We model DNS system as a two-layer/slice traffic-aware resource allocation framework, where every layer uses a separate two-step matching game in order to serve Tactile users (TUs) and low-priority users (LUs). We propose a subgame Nash stable and two-sided exchange stable concepts as solutions of the proposed two-layer traffic-aware resource allocation. Our numerical results show that network operators and UEs (either TUs or LUs) significantly benefit from deploying the FRAN rather than conventional cloudbased radio access networks (CRANs).},

  abstract = {To satisfy diverse use cases and business models in fifth generation (5G) wireless communication, network slicing in fog radio access networks (F-RANs) is proposed, which provides a cost efficient networking in a convenient way. However, the resource management for network slices is challenging, especially when the edge caching is utilized to alleviate the fronthaul burden and reduce the delay. In this paper, we investigate the joint sub-carrier allocation and caching placement for two network slices, and an average delay optimization problem for one slice with user data rate guarantee for the other slice is formulated, which can be solved by a two-step iterative algorithm. The core idea is to optimize decoupled variables iteratively via Hungarian method, linear integer programming, and geometric programming(GP) with the help of decomposition. Simulation results reveal a fast convergence speed and a near-optimal performance of the proposed algorithm.},

It enables operators to construct network slices with similar qualities as dedicated stand-alone networks, but to realize them on a common physical platform. Meanwhile, the isolation among logical network slices can keep them from the negative impacts of other network slices. In this paper, we give an overview of the radio access network (RAN) slicing, and present some viewpoints on three categories of network slices. Moreover, an approach, which dynamically creates RAN slice to meet specific business and service requirements, is proposed.

The infrastructure provider (InP) allocates the RAN slices to the mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), and the MVNOs then allocate the radio resources to the users. It is challenging for the InP to determine resource allocation strategy efficiently due to the selfish strategic responses of both the MVNOs and the users. To handle this issue, we propose a tri-level Stackelberg game to jointly solve the frequency and power allocation and payment negotiation problem among the three levels. Simulation results verify a general market principle that the more the MVNOs focus on revenue collecting, the lower payoff the InP and the users will obtain.},

In this paper, to make the network slicing in F-RANs work efficiently, the radio resource allocation for different network slices is exploited in a downlink F-RAN with device-to-device communication, which is logically partitioned into a high-transmission-rate slice and a low-latency slice. A multi-objective optimization problem is presented with respect to diverse QoS demands, which can be formulated as a single-objective optimization problem with a linear weighted sum method. Then an equivalent drift-plus-penalty minimization problem with Lyapunov optimization is proposed, in which two subproblems are partitioned and solved by weighted minimum mean square error approach and Lagrange dual decomposition method, respectively. Numerical results confirm that a [O(1/V ), O(V )] utility-delay tradeoff is obtained, in which either a 34.5\% reduction in the queuing delay or a 6.5\% increase in the average weighted utility can be achieved in a specific model by choosing proper values of V .},

Unlike core network slicing, radio access network (RAN) slicing is still at its infancy, with several works just starting to investigate the challenges and potentials to enable a mutli-tenant, multi-service RAN. One of the major challenges in RAN slicing is to provide different levels of resource isolation, through resource abstraction, virtualization, and splitting among different tenants/services, while at the same time providing multiplexing gains. To this end, in this work we propose a detailed approach for radio resource virtualization, leveraging different resource abstraction types. Based on it, we formulate the problem of inter-slice resource partitioning and allocation, and propose an algorithm to efficiently tackle this problem. Finally, we provide simulation results that support the benefits of resource abstraction and our proposed algorithm.},

To make the network slicing work more efficiently, a downlink F-RAN, equipped with a ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) slice and an enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) slice logically, is concerned in this paper. A delayaware resource allocation optimization problem is formulated, aiming to maximize the throughput of the eMBB slice as well as guarantee the queuing delay performance of the URLLC slice. The delay-aware optimization problem is reformulated as a perslot joint resource block (RB) and power allocation problem, which is addressed by Lagrange dual decomposition method. Simulation results show a tradeoff between the throughput and the queuing delay of eMBB slice can be achieved while satisfying the delay constraint of URLLC slice.},

  abstract = {The Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN) has clearly emerged as a promising evolution of wireless networks. This architecture consists in decoupling the baseband units (BBUs) from the remote radio heads (RRHs). The BBUs are pooled in the same centralized BBU pool, while the RRHs are distributed through different distant sites. Typically, the one-toone logical mapping consists in assigning one BBU to one RRH so that distinct frames are generated for each RRH. Also, a logical mapping of one BBU to many RRHs could be established in order to deliver the same frames of a single BBU to a cluster of RRHs. Motivated by the network slicing concept, we propose a hybrid transmission strategy where the resource units (RUs) of each frame are partitioned in two slices. The first one constitutes the unshared slice and is allocated to the cell center users (CCUs) according to the one-to-one logical mapping. The second slice is constituted by a quantity of RUs shared by a cluster of RRHs that belong to the same BBU. This last common slice is transmitted according to the one-to-many mapping in order to be allocated to the cell edge users (CEUs) and to the mobile users (MUs). We also present a flexible solution that dynamically adjusts the BBURRH mapping scheme (i.e., one-to-one, one-to-many or hybrid) based on the radio resource usage of BBUs. On the one hand, our proposed solution achieves close packet delay to the one-toone configuration, while providing lower power consumption and handover frequency. On the other hand, in comparison with the one-to-many configuration, our technique provides lower packet delay and subsequently better Quality of Service (QoS).},

However, due to the introduction of NS into radio access networks (RAN) forming a UE-BS-NS three-layer association, handoff becomes very complicated and cannot be resolved by conventional policies. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement LEarning based Smart handoff policy with data Sharing, named LESS, to reduce handoff cost while maintaining user QoS requirements in RAN slicing. Considering the large action space introduced by multiple users and the data sparsity problem due to user mobility, LESS is designed to have two components: 1) LESS-DL, a modified distributed Q-learning algorithm with small action space to make handoff decisions; 2) LESS-DS, a data sharing mechanism using limited data to improve the accuracy of handoff decisions made by LESS-DL. The proposed LESS mechanism uses LESS-DL to choose both the target base station and NS when a handoff occurs, and then updates the Q-values of each user according to LESS-DS. Numerical results show that in typical scenarios, LESS can significantly reduce the handoff cost when compared with traditional handoff policies without learning.},

  abstract = {Nowadays mobile networks are asked to support different applications and services characterized by very specific Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. With this aim in mind, deploying network slices with particular resource allocation policies on a per-service basis becomes extremely relevant. In this regard, we introduce a solution able to dynamically partition the underlying physical infrastructure of a mobile radio access network into multiple logical slices with distinctive service-level agreements. We leverage Software-Defined Networking principles to provide fine-grained flow identification and sophisticated QoS management policies on a generic architecture supporting 4G and 5G networks with the objective of mapping the path towards the future mobile networks. The experimental evaluation of the deployed prototype on a real-world testbed has demonstrated the slicing capabilities of the system while ensuring full performance and functional isolation. We release the entire implementation under a permissive APACHE 2.0 license for academic use.},

  abstract = {Radio access network (RAN) slicing realizes a vision where physical network resources that belong to a specific infrastructure provider can be shared among multiple mobile network operators (MNOs). Existing work in this area has addressed RAN slicing at different levels of network abstractions, but has often neglected the multitude of tightly intertwined inter-level operations involved in real-world slicing systems. For this reason, this article discusses a novel framework for operator-to-waveform 5G RAN slicing. In the proposed framework, slicing operations are treated holistically, including MNO’s selection of base stations (BSs) and maximum number of users, down to the waveform-level scheduling of resource blocks. Experimental results show that the proposed framework provides up to 150\% improvement in terms of number of resource blocks that can be used to enable 5G transmission technologies that require coordination and synchronization among BSs.},

  abstract = {New verticals within the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm such as smart cities, smart farming, or goods monitoring, among many others, are demanding strong requirements to the Radio Access Network (RAN) in terms of coverage, end-node’s power consumption, and scalability. The technologies employed so far to provide IoT scenarios with connectivity, e.g., wireless sensor network and cellular technologies, are not able to simultaneously cope with these three requirements. Thus, a novel solution known as Low Power - Wide Area Network (LP-WAN) has emerged as a promising alternative to provide with low-cost and low-power-consumption connectivity to end-nodes spread in a wide area. Concretely, the Long-Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) technology is one of the LP-WAN platforms that is receiving greater attention from both the industry and the academia. For that reason, in this work, a comprehensive performance evaluation of LoRaWAN under different environmental conditions is presented. The results are obtained from three real scenarios, namely, urban, suburban, and rural, considering both dynamic and static conditions, hence a discussion about the most proper LoRaWAN physical-layer configuration for each scenario is provided. Besides, a theoretical coverage study is also conducted by the use of a radio planning tool considering topographic maps and a precise propagation model. From the attained results, it can be concluded that it is necessary to evaluate the propagation conditions of the deployment scenario prior to the system implantation in order to reach a compromise between the robustness of the network and the transmission data-rate.},
