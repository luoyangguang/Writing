\section{Architecture} \label{sec:Approach}

Research in \ac{IoT} field usually pay attention to energy consumption by optimizing the data transmission rate or by aggregating the data.
However,
	in an urgent situation like a disaster monitoring service,
	data accuracy becomes very important.
Furthermore,
	these data are required to achieve the network server quickly over \ac{CoAP} or \ac{MQTT} as shown in \reffig{iot} to make the appropriate decisions to evacuate people.
For this reason,
	we use an edge computing server that receives data from \ac{IoT} devices by means of IEEE.802.15.4 and LoRa technologies.
This requires to make the LoRa gateway able to forward received packets to the IEEE802.15.4 border router and vice versa.
