%Identifying Spam Without Peeking at the Contents
%Currently available solutions attempt to filter out spam based on analyzing the contents of the message and calculating a score to indicate the 'spami-ness' of the message.
%However,
%	users can typically identify their junk email without having to open and read the contents of the specific message.
%In this article,
%	we outline the general problem,
%	review current options,
%	and propose a new user-level behavior model to identify spam messages.
%We show the performance of this approach and discuss some applications and future directions.
