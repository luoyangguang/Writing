\section{Results exploitation} \label{sec:Results exploitation}

% Initiation
%Below we report the results of applying the contagion process model to the Enron Email dataset.


% Final findings
%In summary,
%	results presented in this section show that if the trust coefficient between users is up to 0.8,
%	the vulnerability diffusion process through trust relationship is at its high level of speed.
%This what happens when a new information appears in a communication network and users forward it largely in the network.
%In addition,
%	this work gives a new insight to understand the relationship between trust,
%	reputation,
%	individual vulnerability and social vulnerability in the context of messaging services such as emails.
