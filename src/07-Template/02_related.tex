%All previous work didn't take into consideration the topological aspect of interactions to measure social vulnerabilities of users.
%The closest study to our approach is that presented in \cite{zeng_trustaware_2014}.
%However,
%	this solution doesn't study the impact of having interactions with vulnerable users.
%In this paper,
%	we study the impact of trusting vulnerable users in preserving the privacy of all users in the communication network.
