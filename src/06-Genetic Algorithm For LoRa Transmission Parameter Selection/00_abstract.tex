% Cause of the problem 1 ------------------------------------------------
The exponential \red{growth} of \red{\ac{IoT}} applications in both industry and academic research raises many questions in wireless sensor network\red{s}.
% Cause of the problem 2 ------------------------------------------------
Heterogeneous networks of IoT devices strongly depend on the ability of IoT devices to adapt their data transmission parameters to each application requirement.
% The problem ------------------------------------------------
One of the most important problem of the emerging IoT networks is the limitation in terms of energy consumption and computation capability.
% Motivation to solve this problem ------------------------------------------------
\red{These limitations} could be addressed by using the edge computing to unload IoT devices from additional computation tasks.
Our work is motivated by the idea of matching each transmission configuration with a reward and cost values to satisfy applications constraints.
% Goal ------------------------------------------------
Our goal is to make IoT devices able to select the optimal configuration and send their data to the gateway with the QoS required by IoT applications.
% Challenges ------------------------------------------------
\red{In this work, we use LoRa network to evaluate the efficiency of our algorithm.}
Determining the best configuration among \red{6720 LaRa transmission settings} is challenging.
The difficulty is mainly due to the lack of tools that could take all applications requirements into account to select the best settings.
% Approach 1 ------------------------------------------------
To address this problem,
	we use a genetic algorithm in an edge computing to select the transmission parameters needed by the application.
Each LoRa configuration represents a feature that needs to be selected to match better the QoS criteria.
% Approach 2 ------------------------------------------------
Particularly,
	we analyze the impact of selecting one configuration in 3 kinds of applications:
	text,
	voice and image transmission by modeling a new adaptive data rate selection process.
% Validation ------------------------------------------------
%We validate our approach by using both simulation and a real environment testbed.

% % Results1 ------------------------------------------------
% Simulation results show that over-trusting vulnerable users speeds the vulnerability diffusion process through the network.
% % Results2 ------------------------------------------------
% Furthermore,
% vulnerable users with high reputation level lead to a high convergence level of infection,
% this means that the vulnerability contagion process infects the biggest number of users when vulnerable users get a high level of trust from their interlocutors.
