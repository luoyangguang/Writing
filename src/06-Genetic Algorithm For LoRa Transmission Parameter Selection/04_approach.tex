\section{Proposed Framework} \label{sec:Approach}


% A generic scheme to solve the configuration selection problem and any other similar selection problem is given in this section..
% The genetic selection scheme consists of three main steps,
% 	the first step contains a set of small parallel fuzzy logic (FL)-based subsystems,
% 	the second step is a multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) system,
% 	and the third step is a genetic algorithm (GA)-based component to assign a suitable weight for the criteria in the second component.
% The scheme decision phase can be described in more detail as follows.

% 			\textbf{Mutate:} child configurations with pm\;

The \red{selection process scheme} illustrated \red{in \reffig{genetic}} can be described following these five steps:

\Figure{h}{1}{genetic}{The proposed scheme for LoRa transmission parameters selection based on \ac{GA}, \ac{FL} and Multi-Criteria Decision Making \ac{MCDM}}

\begin{enumerate}
\item According to the Semtech SX1276 \red{LoRa transceiver} \cite{lorasemtech},
	there \red{are} 6720 possible settings ($s_{1}$, ... , $s_{6720}$) and the framework has to select the most optimal one or to rank them according to their relevance.
\item The first step of the selection process depends on multiple criteria up to i ($c_{1}$, ... , $c_{i}$).
	Different type of criteria can be measured from different sources to cover the maximum point of views,
	as \red{an} example,
	the network server requirements,
	the applications requirements and the devices conditions.
\item The Fuzzy Logic (FL) based subsystem gives an initial score for each configuration that reflects its relevance.
The different sets of scores ($d_{1}$, ... , $d_{i}$) are sent to the \ac{MCDM} in the $5^{th}$ step.
\item At the same time,
	the \ac{GA} \cite{alkhawlani_access_2008} assigns a suitable weight ($w_{1}$, ..., $w_{i}$) for each initial selection decision,
	this selection is made according to the objective function that is required by the application.
	% according to the importance and sensitivities of ANS criteria to the different characteristics of a wireless heterogeneous environment.
\item Using the initial scores coming from the $3^{rd}$ step and the weights using the $4^{th}$ step,
	the multi criteria decision making{} \ac{MCDM} will select the most relevant settings and rank them according to their reward.
\end{enumerate}
