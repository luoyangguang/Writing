\section{Discussion} \label{sec:Conclusion}


% Restate the main contribution ------------------------------------------------
Our main contribution was to build 3 applications that requires 3 different levels of QoS,
	such as text,
	sound and image transmission.
We used a low cost LoRa gateway on a Raspberry-pi with 2 Arduino boards equipped with 2 LoRa Transceivers based on the Semtech SX1276 specification.
% Restate the main challenges ------------------------------------------------
The main challenge \red{addressed in this work} was to explore the application of genetic algorithm in LoRa transmission parameter selection.
%The efficiency of such algorithms is measured by the ability to satisfy each application requirement.
% Restate the main findings ------------------------------------------------
To measure the accuracy of applying genetic algorithm in an edge computing we expect to compare our approach with other adaptive data rate solutions.
% Our simulations compare the performance of each configuration selection.






% homogeneous and heterogeneous deployments as a function of the number of nodes and traffic intensity.
% First,
% we have analyzed homogeneous deployments for different SFs from SF6 to SF12.
% Simulations show better performance for the SF6 deployment but reduced cell coverage.
% Second,
% we have compared heterogeneous and homogeneous deployments:
% the Heterogeneous deployment that selects its LoRa configuration according to its link budget results in the best PDR and throughput,
% as well as the lowest average power consumption compared to other deployments,
% for a different number of nodes and different traffic intensity.
% The results clearly show the benefits of heterogeneity for large scale network deployments and the need for adaptive SF allocation strategies.
% % Future challenges current bad state
% As a future work,
% we plan to validate our appproach by using both simulation and real enviroment testbeds.

% We plane to study the performance of applying our approach in terms of PDR,
% throughput,
% and power consumption.
% The module will optimally select the configuration according to the scenario criteria (e.g.,
% high data rate,
% energy efficiency,
% or network congestion) and the radio environment (e.g.,
% link budget,
% level of interference,
% device mobility).
